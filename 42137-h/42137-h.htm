<h1 title="">THE MAGIC CURTAIN</h1>
<h2 id="c1"><br />CHAPTER I
<br />A FACE IN THE DARK</h2>
<p>It was that mystic hour when witches are
abroad in the land: one o&rsquo;clock in the morning.
The vast auditorium of the Civic Opera
House was a well of darkness and silence.</p>
<p>Had you looked in upon this scene at this
eerie hour you would most certainly have said,
&ldquo;There is no one here. This grandest of all auditoriums
is deserted.&rdquo; But you would have
been mistaken.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">[12]</div>
<p>Had you been seated in the box at the left
side of this great auditorium, out of that vast
silence you might have caught a sound. Faint,
indistinct, like the rustle of a single autumn
leaf, like a breath of air creeping over a glassy
sea at night, it would have arrested your attention
and caused you to focus your eyes upon
a pair of exceedingly long drapes at the side
of the opera hall. These drapes might have
concealed some very long windows. In reality
they did not.</p>
<p>Had you fixed your attention upon this spot
you might, in that faint light that was only
a little less than absolute darkness, have seen
a vague, indistinct spot of white. This spot,
resting as it did at a position above the bottom
of the drape where a short person&rsquo;s head would
have come, might have startled you.</p>
<p>And well it might. For this was in truth
the face of a living being. This mysterious individual
was garbed in a dress suit of solemn
black. That is why only his face shone out in
the dark.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">[13]</div>
<p>This person, seemingly a golden haired
youth with features of unusual fineness, had
called himself Pierre Andrews when, a short
time earlier, he had applied for a position as
usher in the Opera. Because of his almost startling
beauty, his perfect manners and his
French accent, he had been hired on the spot
and had been given a position in the boxes
where, for this &ldquo;first night&rdquo; at least, those who
possessed the great wealth of the city had been
expected to foregather.</p>
<p>They had not failed to appear. And why
should they fail? Was this not their night of
nights, the night of the &ldquo;Grand Parade&rdquo;?</p>
<p>Ah, yes, they had been there in all their bejewelled
and sable-coated splendor. Rubies
and diamonds had vied with emeralds and
sapphires on this grand occasion. Yes, they
had been here. But now they had departed and
there remained only this frail boy, hovering
there on the ledge like a frightened gray bat.</p>
<p>Why was he here? Certainly a timid-appearing
boy would not, without some very pressing
reason, remain hidden behind drapes at
the edge of a great empty space which until
that night had been practically unknown to
him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">[14]</div>
<p>And, indeed, at this moment the place, with
its big empty spaces, its covered seats, its
broad, deserted stage, seemed haunted, haunted
by the ghosts of other years, by all those
who, creeping from out the past, had stalked
upon its stage; haunted, too, by those who
only one or two short years before had paraded
there on a &ldquo;first night&rdquo; in splendor, but
who now, laid low by adverse circumstances,
crept about in places of poverty. Yet, haunted
or no, here was this frail boy peeking timidly
out from his hiding place as the clock struck
one.</p>
<p>He had asked a curious question on this
night, had this boy of golden locks and expressive
blue eyes. It was during the recess between
acts while the curtain was down and
the pomp that was Egypt had for a moment
been replaced by the pomp that is America.
Leaning over the balustrade, this thoughtful
boy had witnessed the &ldquo;Grand Parade&rdquo; of
wealth and pomp that passed below him. Between
massive pillars, beneath chandeliers of
matchless splendor where a thousand lights
shone, passed ladies of beauty and unquestioned
refinement. With capes of royal purple
trimmed in ermine or sable but slightly concealing
bare shoulders and breasts where jewels
worth a king&rsquo;s ransom shone, they glided
gracefully down the long corridor. Bowing
here and there, or turning to whisper a word
to their companions, they appeared to be saying
to all the throng that beheld them:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">[15]</div>
<p>&ldquo;See! Are we not the glory that is America
in all her wealth and power?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then it was that this mysterious boy, poised
there upon the ledge still half hidden by
drapes, had asked his question. Turning to a
white-haired, distinguished-looking man close
beside him, a man whom he had never before
seen, he had said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this life?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The answer he received had been quite as
unusual as the question. Fixing strangely luminous
eyes upon him, the man had said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a form of life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A form of life.&rdquo; Even at this moment the
boy, standing in the shadows timid and terribly
afraid, was turning these words over in
his mind. &ldquo;A form of life.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">[16]</div>
<p>There had been about him, even as he had
performed his simple duties as usher in the
boxes on this night, an air of mystery. He
had walked&mdash;more than one had noted this&mdash;with
the short, quick steps of a girl. His hair,
too, was soft and fine, his cheeks like the softest
velvet. But then, he was French. His accent
told this. And who knows what the
French are like? Besides, his name was Pierre.
He had said this more than once. And Pierre,
as everyone knows, is the name of a boy.</p>
<p>It was during the curtain before the last act
that an incident had occurred which, for a few
of the resplendent throng, had dimmed the
glory of that night.</p>
<p>No great fuss was made about the affair.
A slim girl seated in the box occupied by the
man whose great wealth had made this opera
house possible, had leaned over to whisper excited
words in this gray-haired millionaire&rsquo;s
ears. With fingers that trembled, she had
touched her bare neck.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">[17]</div>
<p>With perfect poise the man had beckoned
to a broad-shouldered person in black who had
until now remained in the shadows. The man
had glided forward. Some words had been
spoken. Among these words were: &ldquo;Search
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One would have said that the golden-haired
usher standing directly behind the box had
caught these words for he had suddenly turned
white and clutched at the railing to escape
falling.</p>
<p>Had you looked only a moment later at the
spot where he had stood you might have noted
that he was not there. And now here he was
on the ledge, still all but concealed by drapes,
poised as if for further flight.</p>
<p>And yet he did not flee. Instead, dropping
farther into the shadows, he appeared to lose
himself in thought.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">[18]</div>
<p>What were these thoughts? One might suppose
that he was recasting in his mind the
events of the immediate past, that he read
again the look of surprise and consternation
on the face of the beautiful child of the very
rich when she discovered that the string of
beautifully matched pearls, bought by her
father in Europe at a fabulous cost, were gone.
One might suppose that he once again contemplated
flight as the stout, hard-faced detective,
who had so opportunely materialized from the
shadows, had suggested searching the ushers
and other attendants; that he shuddered again
as he thought how barely he had escaped capture
as, in the darkness attending the last act,
he had glided past eagle-eyed sleuth Jaeger,
and concealed himself behind the draperies.
One might suppose that he lived again those
moments of suspense when a quiet but very
thorough search had revealed neither the priceless
pearls nor his own humble person.</p>
<p>Yes, one might suppose all this. Yet, if one
did, he would suppose in vain. Our minds are
the strangest creation of God. &ldquo;The thoughts
of youth are long, long thoughts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young person still half concealed by
draperies and quite hidden by darkness was
living again, not the scenes enacted among the
boxes, but those which had been enacted upon
the stage.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">[19]</div>
<p>In his mind&rsquo;s eye he saw again the glory
that once was Egypt. Picturing himself as the
heroine, Aida, he loved the prince of all
Egypt&rsquo;s warriors, and at the same time shuddered
for her people.</p>
<p>As Radames, he heard the shouts of his people
when he returned as a triumphant victor.</p>
<p>As Amneris, the Egyptian princess in the
stately boat of those ancient days beneath a
golden moon, he glided down the blue Nile.
And all the time, as the matchless beauty of
the scenes and the exquisite melody of the
music filled him with raptures that could not
be described, he was saying to himself:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, for one golden moment to stand before
that assembled throng&mdash;all the rich, the
learned of the great of this city&mdash;and to feel
the glory of the past about me! To know love
and adventure, the daring of a Captain of the
Guard, the tender sentiments of an Aida, and
to express it all in song! To do all this and to
feel that every heart in that throng beats in
rapture or in sorrow, as my own! What glory!
What matchless joy!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">[20]</div>
<p>And yet, even as these last thoughts passed
into eternity, the young head with its crown
of gold fell forward. There was a moment of
relaxation expressing pain and all but hopeless
despair. Then, like a mouse creeping out
from the dark, he slipped from his place to
glide stealthily along among the shadows and
at last disappear into that place of darkness
that is a great auditorium at night.</p>
<p>Having felt his way across a tier of boxes,
he vaulted lightly over a low rail. Passing
through a narrow corridor, he touched a door
and pushed it noiselessly open. He was met
by a thin film of light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too much,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;I shall be
seen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Backing away, he retraced his steps.</p>
<p>Having moved a long way to the right, he
tried still another door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, it is better,&rdquo; he breathed.</p>
<p>A moment later he found himself on the
ground floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the way out?&rdquo; He whispered the words
to the vast silence that was all about him. No
answer came to him. Yet, even as he paused,
uncertainly, a sound reached his ears.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">[21]</div>
<p>&ldquo;A watchman. In the concourse. This is the
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sprang toward the stage. A mouse could
scarcely have made less sound, as, gliding
down the carpeted aisle, he at last reached a
door at the left of the stage.</p>
<p>The door creaked as he opened it. With one
wild start, he dashed across the gaping stage
to enter a narrow passageway.</p>
<p>Another moment and he was before a door
that led to the outer air. It was locked, from
within.</p>
<p>With breath that came short and quick, he
stood there listening intently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Footsteps.&rdquo; He did not so much as whisper
the words. &ldquo;The watchman. There is need for
haste.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The lock. Perhaps there is a key. Ah, yes,
here it is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His skilled fingers fumbled in the darkness
for a moment. The light from without
streamed in. The door closed. He was gone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">[22]</div>
<h2 id="c2"><br />CHAPTER II
<br />PETITE JEANNE&rsquo;S MASQUERADE</h2>
<p>Fifteen minutes after his disappearance
into the shadows, the youth, still clad in
a dress suit, might have been seen walking
between the massive pillars that front the
Grand Opera House. Despite the fact that his
small white hands clasped and unclasped nervously,
he was able to maintain a certain air
of nonchalance until a figure, emerging from
the shadow cast by a pillar, sprang toward
him.</p>
<p>At that instant he appeared ready for flight.
One glance at the other, and he indulged in
a low chuckle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is you!&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is I. But what could have kept you?&rdquo;
The person who spoke was a girl. A large,
strongly built person, she contrasted strangely
with her slender companion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">[23]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Circumstances over which I had no control,&rdquo;
the youth replied. &ldquo;But come on!&rdquo; He
shuddered. &ldquo;I am freezing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having hurried west across the bridge, they
entered a long concourse. From this they
emerged into a railway station. Having
crossed the waiting room, the slim one entered
an elevator, leaving the other to wait below.</p>
<p>When the slim one reappeared he was
wrapped from head to toe in a great blue coat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, this is better, <i>ma chere</i>,&rdquo; he murmured,
as he tucked a slender arm into his companion&rsquo;s
own and prepared to accompany her into
the chill of night.</p>
<p>The apartment they entered half an hour
later was neither large nor new. It was well
furnished and gave forth an air of solid comfort.
The living quarters consisted of a narrow
kitchen and a fair-sized living-room. At
either side of the living-room were doors that
led each to a private room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">[24]</div>
<p>The big girl walked to the fireplace where a
pile of kindling and firewood lay waiting. Having
touched a match to this pile, she stood
back to watch it break into a slow blaze, and
then go roaring up the chimney.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;How cozy we shall
be in just a moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes, yes, <i>mon ami</i>!&rdquo; The slight one patted
her cheek. &ldquo;We shall indeed. But anon&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The private door to the right closed with a
slight rush of air. The slim one had vanished.</p>
<p>The stout girl&rsquo;s gown revealed a powerful
chest. Every curve of her well-formed body
suggested strength, while the blonde-haired
one, with all her slender shapeliness, seemed
little more than a child&mdash;and a girl, at that.
Yet, one cannot fully forget the dress suit that
at this moment must rest upon a hanger somewhere
behind that closed door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, now tell me about it,&rdquo; said the stout
one, as, some moments later, the blonde one
reappeared in a heavy dressing gown and sat
down before the fire.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">[25]</div>
<p>&ldquo;A pearl necklace was stolen,&rdquo; the slight
one said in a quiet tone. &ldquo;It was worth, oh,
untold sacks of gold. <i>Mon Dieu!</i> How is one
to say how much? Since I was near, I was
suspected. Who can doubt it? I bolted. In
the darkness I concealed myself in the drapes
that seemed to hide a window and did not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why did you run? You could not have
done worse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, <i>mon Dieu</i>! There was talk of searching
us. Could I be searched?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; A broad smile overspread the stout
girl&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;No, you could not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, my good friend! <i>Ma chere!</i> My beloved
Florence.&rdquo; The slender one patted the
other&rsquo;s cheek with true affection. &ldquo;You agree
with me. What else can matter? You have
made me happy for all my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So now you know that this large, capable
girl is none other than an old friend, one you
have met many times, Florence Huyler. But
wait, there is still more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how now is it all to end?&rdquo; Two lines
appeared between the large girl&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall return!&rdquo; the other exclaimed. &ldquo;Tomorrow
night I shall go back. I must go! It
is too wonderful for words. All the rich, the
great ones. The sable coats, the gowns, the
rare jewels. And the stage! Oh, my friend,
how perfectly exquisite, how glorious!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">[26]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and they&rsquo;ll arrest you.&rdquo; The large
girl&rsquo;s tone was matter-of-fact. &ldquo;And what will
you see after that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For what will they arrest me? Did I take
the necklace? No! No! Nevair!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you ran away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and for a very good reason.&rdquo; A faint
flush appeared on the slim one&rsquo;s cheek. &ldquo;I
could not be searched.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And will you tell them why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then how can you go back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen, my friend.&rdquo; The slim one laid an
impressive hand on the other&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;Sometimes
we have good fortune, is it not so? Yes.
It is so. The young lady, that girl who lost
the necklace, she will be there. She is kind.
Something tells me this. She will not have
Pierre Andrews arrested. Something tells me
so. For look, now, as Pierre I am&mdash;how did
you say it?&mdash;very handsome!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">[27]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But, Petite Jeanne!&rdquo; Florence broke short
off. By this exclamation she had betrayed a
secret. Since, however, only the walls and her
companion heard it, it did not much matter.
Our old friend, Petite Jeanne (the little French
girl), and Pierre Andrews are one and the
same person. On the stage Jeanne had played
many a role. Now she was playing one in real
life and playing it for a grand prize.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>But we must go back a little. Petite Jeanne,
as you will recall if you have read that other
book, <i>The Gypsy Shawl</i>, was a little French girl
found wandering with the gypsies among the
hills of France. Brought by a rich benefactress
to America, she had made a splendid showing
on the stage as a star in light opera.</p>
<p>All stage productions, however, have their
runs and are no more. Petite Jeanne&rsquo;s engagement
had come to an end, leaving her with a
pocketful of money and one great yearning, a
yearning to have a place upon the stage in
Grand Opera.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">[28]</div>
<p>This longing had come to her through contact
with a celebrated opera star, Marjory
Dean. Through Marjory Dean she had secured
the services of a great teacher. For some
time after that she had devoted her entire time
to the mastering of the technique of Grand
Opera and to the business of developing her
voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will not go far without study abroad,&rdquo;
Marjory Dean had warned her. &ldquo;Yet, who
knows but that some golden opportunity may
come to you? You have a voice, thin to be
sure, but very clear and well placed. What is
still more, you have a feeling for things. You
are capable of inspiring your audience with
feelings of love, hate, hope, despair. This will
carry you far.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I shall work! Oh, how I shall work!&rdquo;
Jeanne had replied.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">[29]</div>
<p>That had been months ago. But teachers
must be paid. Jeanne&rsquo;s pocketful of money no
longer weighed her down. Then, too, times
were hard. The little French girl could make
people feel the things she did on the stage because
she, too, had a warm heart. She could
not resist wandering from time to time into
the tenement districts where dwelt her gypsy
friends. There she found poverty and great
need. Always she came away with an empty
purse. On Maxwell Street it was no better.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall apply for work,&rdquo; she had told Florence
at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what can you do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can act. I can sing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But no one wants you to act or sing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the stage,&rdquo; Jeanne had shrugged, &ldquo;perhaps
no. But in life one may always act a part.
I shall act. But what shall I be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, now!&rdquo; she had cried a moment later.
&ldquo;I shall be a boy. I shall become an usher, an
usher in Grand Opera. If I may not be on the
stage, I may at least spend every night in the
aisles. I shall see all the operas, and I shall
earn a little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Petite Jeanne!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">[30]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No! No! Do not resist me!&rdquo; Jeanne had
cried. &ldquo;I will do it. I must! It is my soul, my
life, the stage, the opera. Hours each day I
shall be near it. Perhaps I may steal out upon
the stage and sing an aria when the hall is
dark. Perhaps, too, I shall meet Marjory
Dean, the great one this city adores.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And who knows,&rdquo; she had clasped her
hands in ecstasy, &ldquo;who knows but that in some
mysterious way my opportunity may come?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;My opportunity,&rdquo; she thought now, as, sitting
before the glowing fire, she contemplated
the future, &ldquo;appears to be a bed in jail. But
who knows?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jeanne refused to be depressed. Casting off
her dressing gown, she sprang away in a wild
dance as she chanted:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Now I am Pierre,</p>
<p class="t0">Now I am Jeanne.</p>
<p class="t0">To-night I sleep on eiderdown,</p>
<p class="t0">To-morrow I am in jail.</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, sweet mystery of life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her voice rang out high and clear. Then,
like the flash of sunshine across the brow of a
hill, her mood changed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">[31]</div>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow!&rdquo; she exclaimed, dropping into
the depths of a great chair by the fire. &ldquo;Why
think of to-morrow? See! The tea kettle sings
for us. Why not one good cup of black tea?
And then&mdash;sweet dreams.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A moment later there was a clinking of thin
china cups. A belated midnight lunch was
served.</p>
<p>An hour later, as Petite Jeanne twisted her
pink toes beneath her silk-covered eiderdown,
brought all the way from her beloved France,
she whispered low:</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And after a time, once again, faint, indistinct
like a word from a dream:</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">[32]</div>
<h2 id="c3"><br />CHAPTER III
<br />ON THE VERGE OF ADVENTURE</h2>
<p>Long after Petite Jeanne&rsquo;s dainty satin
slippers had danced her off to bed, Florence
Huyler sat before the fire thinking. If
your acquaintance with Florence is of long
standing, you will know that she was possessed
of both courage and strength. For some
time a gymnasium director, she had developed
her splendid physical being to the last degree.
Even now, though her principal business in
life had for some time been that of keeping
up with the little French girl, she spent three
hours each day in the gymnasium and swimming
pool. Her courage surpassed her
strength; yet as she contemplated the step
Petite Jeanne had taken and the events which
must immediately follow that move, she trembled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">[33]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all too absurd, anyway,&rdquo; she told herself.
&ldquo;She wants to be an opera singer, so she
dresses herself up like a boy and becomes an
usher. What good could possibly come of
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>All the time she was thinking this she realized
that her objections were futile. Petite
Jeanne believed in Fate. Fate would take her
where she wished to go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If she wished to marry the President&rsquo;s son,
she&rsquo;d become a maid in the White House. And
then&mdash;&rdquo; Florence paused. She dared not say
that Petite Jeanne would not attain her end.
Up to this moment Jeanne had surmounted all
obstacles. Adopted by the gypsies, she had
lived in their camps for years. She had inherited
their fantastic attitude toward life. For
her nothing was entirely real, and nothing unattainable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But to-morrow night!&rdquo; Florence shuddered.
The little French girl meant to don
her dress suit and as Pierre Andrews return
to her post as usher in the boxes of that most
magnificent of all opera houses.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">[34]</div>
<p>&ldquo;A necklace worth thousands of dollars was
stolen.&rdquo; She reviewed events. &ldquo;Petite Jeanne
was near. When they looked for her, she had
vanished. She stole the necklace. What could
be more certain than this? She stole it! They
will say that. They&rsquo;ll arrest her on sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She stole it.&rdquo; She repeated the words
slowly. &ldquo;Did she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The very question shocked her. Petite
Jeanne was no thief. This she knew right well.
She had no need to steal. She still had a little
money in the bank. Yet, as a means to an end,
had she taken the necklace, intending later to
return it?</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! No!&rdquo; she whispered aloud. &ldquo;Jeanne
is reckless, but she&rsquo;d never do that!</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where is the necklace? Who did take
it?&rdquo; For a time she endeavored to convince
herself that the precious string of pearls, having
become unclasped, had slipped to the floor,
that it had been discovered and even now was
in its youthful owner&rsquo;s possession.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No such luck.&rdquo; She prodded the fire vigorously.
&ldquo;In the end fortune smiles upon us.
But in the beginning, nay, nay!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">[35]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And to-morrow evening&mdash;&rdquo; She rose to
fling her splendid arms wide. &ldquo;To-morrow my
little friend walks in, after many brave detectives
have spent the day in a vain search for
her, and says quite nonchalantly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;There you are, madame. Shall I remove
your sable coat? Or will you wear it? And
will you have the chair, so? Or so? <i>Voila!</i>&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who can say it is not going to be dramatic?
Drama in real life! That&rsquo;s what counts most
with Jeanne. Oh, my dear little Jeanne! What
an adorable peck of trouble you are!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And all the time, quite lost in the big, eager,
hungry world that waited just outside her window,
the little French girl lay among her pink
eiderdown quilts and slept the sleep of the
just.</p>
<p>The cold gray dawn of the morning after
found Petite Jeanne considerably shaken in
her mind regarding the outcome of this, her
latest adventure.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">[36]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Will they truly arrest me?&rdquo; she asked herself
as, slipping into a heavy robe, she sought
the comfort of an early fire. &ldquo;And if they arrest
me, what then?&rdquo; She shuddered. She had
once visited a police court in this very city. An
uninviting place it had been, too. With judge
and lawyers alternately laughing and storming
at crestfallen individuals who stood, some
quite bewildered, others with an air of hopelessness
about them, with two women weeping
in a corner, and with an ill-smelling, ogling
group of visitors looking on, the whole place
had depressed her beyond words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am I to stand there to be stared at? Will
the lawyers and the judge make a joke of my
misfortune?&rdquo; She stamped her little foot angrily.
&ldquo;No! No! Nevair! They shall not!</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; she thought more soberly, &ldquo;I
must go back. I truly must!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, why did I run away? Why did I not
say: &lsquo;Search me if you must. You will see that
I do not have your necklace!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But no!&rdquo; She flushed. &ldquo;As Petite Jeanne
I might be searched. But as Pierre. Ah, no!
No!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">[37]</div>
<p>A cup of steaming coffee revived her spirits;
but for a few hours only. Then the dull, drab
day bore down upon her with greater force
than ever.</p>
<p>And indeed it was no sort of day to enliven
spirits and bolster up courage. Gray skies,
gray streets, gray fog, dripping walls of great
buildings, these were all about her. And in
the end a slow, weepy, drizzling rain began
to fall.</p>
<p>There is but one way to endure such a day.
That is to don storm rubbers, raincoat and an
old hat, and defy it. Defy it Petite Jeanne did.
And once in the cool damp of it all, she found
relief.</p>
<p>She wandered on and on. The fog grew
thicker. Clouds hung dark and low. Lights
began to appear. Yet it was not night.</p>
<p>Of a sudden, as she wandered aimlessly on,
she became conscious of an astonishing fact:
numbers of people were hurrying past her. A
strange proceeding on a drab day when men
prefer to be indoors. But strangest of all, each
one of these individuals was shorter than Petite
Jeanne herself. And the little French girl
was far from tall.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">[38]</div>
<p>&ldquo;How extraordinary!&rdquo; she murmured under
her breath. &ldquo;It is as if I were some half-grown
Gulliver in the land of the Pygmies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She knew this was pure fancy. But who
were these people? A look into one storm-clad,
bemuffled face told her the answer:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Orientals. But where can they be going?
They must have come from many places.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The question absorbed her attention. It
drove trouble from her mind. She followed
the one whose face she had scrutinized. In
time she saw him dart up a short flight of
stairs to enter a door on which were inscribed
the words: &ldquo;Members Only.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Other figures appeared. One and all, they
followed in this one&rsquo;s wake.</p>
<p>As Jeanne looked up she saw that the three-story
building was possessed of a highly ornamented
front. Strange and grotesque figures,
dragons, birds of prey, great, ugly faces all
done in wood or metal and painted in gaudy
colors, clustered in every available niche.</p>
<p>Suddenly she was seized with a desire to
follow these little men.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">[39]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But no!&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;They would never
allow me to pass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked for the street number. There
was none. She walked a few paces to the left.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seven, three, seven,&rdquo; she read aloud. She
gave a sudden start. She knew this location.
Only three blocks away was a costumer&rsquo;s shop.
For a dollar or two this costumer would turn
her into any sort of person she might choose to
be, a pirate, an Eskimo, yes, even a Chinaman.
That was his business. At once Jeanne was
on her way to that shop.</p>
<p>In an astonishingly short time she was back;
or at least some person answering her description
as to height, breadth of shoulders, glove
number, etc., was coming down the street.
But was it Jeanne? Perhaps not one of her
best friends could have told. Certainly in the
narrow hallway of that mysterious building,
which little men were still entering, her nationality
was not challenged. To these mysterious
little people, who were gathering for who
knows what good or evil reason, she was for
the moment an Oriental.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">[40]</div>
<h2 id="c4"><br />CHAPTER IV
<br />A LIVING STATUE</h2>
<p>In the meantime Florence, too, had gone for
a walk in the rain. The discovery she made
that day was destined to play a very large part
in her immediate future.</p>
<p>Florence by nature belonged to the country,
not to the city. Fate had, by some strange
trick, cast her lot in the city. But on every possible
occasion she escaped to quiet places
where the rattle and bang of city life were
gone and she might rest her weary feet by
tramping over the good, soft, yielding earth.</p>
<p>Since their rooms were very near the heart
of the city, at first thought it might seem impossible
for her to reach such a spot of tranquility
without enduring an hour-long car ride.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">[41]</div>
<p>This was not true. The city which had for
so long been Florence&rsquo;s home is unique. No
other in the world is like it. Located upon a
swamp, it turned the swamp first into a garden,
then into a city where millions live in
comfort. Finding a stagnant river running
into the lake, it turned the river about and
made it a swift one going from the lake. Lacking
islands upon its shore-line, this enterprising
metropolis proceeded to build islands. A
brisk twenty-minute walk brought Florence to
one of these islands.</p>
<p>This island at that time, though of a considerable
size, was quite incomplete. In time
it was to be a place where millions would tread.
At that moment, save for one dark, dome-shaped
building at its north end, it was a place
of desolation, or so it seemed to Florence.</p>
<p>At either end the land rose several feet
above the surface of the lake. In the center it
was so low that in time of storm waves dashed
completely over it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">[42]</div>
<p>Since the island had been some years in
building a voluntary forest which might better,
perhaps, be called a jungle, had sprung up
on its southern extremity. Beyond this jungle
lay the breakwater where in time of storm
great waves mounted high and came crashing
down upon heaps of limestone rocks as large
as small houses.</p>
<p>To the left of this jungle, on the side facing
the lake, was a narrow, sandy beach. It was
toward this beach that Florence made her way.
There she hoped to spend an hour of quiet
meditation as she promenaded the hard-packed
sand of the beach. Vain hope. Some
one was there before her.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>Petite Jeanne had entered many strange
places. None was more strange nor more fantastically
beautiful than the one she found
within the four walls of that dragon-guarded
building in the heart of a great city.</p>
<p>Playing the role of an American born Chinese
lady, she passed the attendant and
climbed two flights of stairs unmolested.</p>
<p>As she reached the top of the second flight
she found her feet sinking deep in the thick
pile of an Oriental rug. One glance about her
and she gripped at her heart to still it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">[43]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It is a dream!&rdquo; she told herself. &ldquo;There is
no place like this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yet she dared not distrust her senses. Surely
the lovely Chinese ladies, dressed in curious
Chinese garments of matchless silk, gliding
silently about the place, were real; so, too, was
the faint, fragrant odor of incense, and the
lamps that, burning dimly, cast a shadow of
purple and old rose over all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dragons,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;copper dragons
looking as old as time itself. Smoke creeps
from their nostrils as if within them burned
eternal fire. Lamps made of three thousand
bits of glass set in copper. Banners of silk.
Pictures of strange birds. Who could have
planned all this and brought it into being?</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there,&rdquo; she whispered, as she dared
a few steps across the first soft-carpeted space,
&ldquo;there is an altar, an altar to a god wholly unknown
to me. The ladies are kneeling there.
Suppose they invite me to join them!&rdquo; At
once she felt terribly frightened. She sank
deep in the shadows. She was playing the part
of a Chinese lady, yet she knew nothing of
their religion. And this appeared to be a temple.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">[44]</div>
<p>She was contemplating flight when a sound,
breaking in upon her attention, caused her to
pause. From somewhere, seemingly deep
down and far away, came the dong-dong of a
gong. Deep, serene, melodious, it seemed to
call to her. A simple, impulsive child of nature,
she murmured:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It calls. I shall go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Turning her back to the broad stairs that
led down and away to the cool, damp, outer
air, she took three steps downward on a narrow
circular staircase which led, who could
tell where?</p>
<p>Smoke rose from the spaces below, the
smoke of many incense burners.</p>
<p>Pausing there, she seemed about to turn
back. But again came the deep, melodious, all
but human call of the gong. Moving like one
in a trance, she took three more steps downward
and was lost from sight.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">[45]</div>
<p>The person who had disturbed Florence&rsquo;s
hoped-for hour of solitude on the island beach
was a girl. Yet, as Florence first saw her, she
seemed less a living person than a statue.
Tanned by the sun to a shade that matched the
giant rock on which she stood, clad only in a
scant bathing suit that in color matched her
skin, standing rigid, motionless, she seemed a
thing hewn of stone to stand there forever.</p>
<p>Yet, even as Florence looked on entranced,
she flung her arms high, gave vent to a scream
that sent gulls scurrying from rocky roosts,
and then, leaping high, disappeared beneath
the dull surface of the water.</p>
<p>That scream, together with the deft arching
of her superb body as she dove, marked her as
one after Florence&rsquo;s own kind. Gone was her
wish for solitude. One desire possessed her
now: to know this animated statue of the
island.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where does she live?&rdquo; she asked herself.
&ldquo;How can she dare to visit this desolate spot
alone?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">[46]</div>
<p>Even as she asked this question, the girl
emerged from the water, shook back her tangled
hair, drew a rough blue overall over her
dripping bathing suit, and then, leaping away
like a wild deer, cleared the breakwater at a
bound and in a twinkling lost herself on a narrow
path that wound through the jungle of
low willows and cottonwoods.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is gone!&rdquo; Florence exclaimed. &ldquo;I have
lost her!&rdquo; Nevertheless, she went racing along
the beach to enter the jungle over the path the
girl had taken. She had taken up a strange
trail. That trail was short. It ended abruptly.
This she was soon enough to know.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">[47]</div>
<h2 id="c5"><br />CHAPTER V
<br />THE SECRET PLACE</h2>
<p>Petite Jeanne was a person of courage.
Times there had been when, as a
child living with the gypsies of France, she
had believed that she saw a ghost. At the
heart of black woods, beneath a hedge on a
moonless night some white thing lying just
before her had moved in the most blood-chilling
fashion. Never, on such an occasion, had
Jeanne turned to flee. Always, with knees
trembling, heart in her throat, she had
marched straight up to the &ldquo;ghost.&rdquo; Always,
to be sure, the &ldquo;ghost&rdquo; had vanished, but
Jeanne had gained courage by such adventures.
So now, as she glided down the soft-carpeted,
circular staircase with the heavy
odor of incense rising before her and the play
of eerie green lights all about her, she took a
strong grip on herself, bade her fluttering
heart be still, and steadily descended into the
mysterious unknown.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">[48]</div>
<p>The scene that met her gaze as at last she
reached those lower levels, was fantastic in the
extreme. A throng of little brown people,
dressed in richest silks, their faces shining
strangely in the green light, sat in small circles
on rich Oriental rugs.</p>
<p>Scattered about here and there all over the
room were low pedestals and on these pedestals
rested incense burners. Fantastic indeed
were the forms of these burners: ancient dragons
done in copper, eagles of brass with wings
spread wide, twining serpents with eyes of
green jade, and faces, faces of ugly men done
in copper. These were everywhere.</p>
<p>As Jeanne sank silently to a place on the
floor, she felt that some great event in the
lives of these people was about to transpire.
They did not speak; they whispered; and once,
then again, and yet again, their eyes strayed
expectantly to a low stage, built across the far
end of the room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">[49]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What is to happen?&rdquo; the girl asked herself.
She shuddered. To forget that she was
in a secret place at the very heart of a Chinese
temple built near the center of a great city&mdash;this
was impossible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t be here,&rdquo; she chided herself.
&ldquo;Something may happen to me. I may be detained.
I may not be able to reach the Opera
House in time. And then&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She wondered what that would mean. She
realized with a sort of shock that she was
strangely indifferent to it all. Truth was,
events had so shaped themselves that she was
at that moment undecided where her own best
good lay. She had ventured something, had begun
playing the role of a boy. She had done
this that she might gain a remote end. The end
now seemed very remote indeed. The perils
involved in reaching that end had increased
four-fold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why go back at all?&rdquo; she asked herself.
&ldquo;As Pierre I can die very comfortably. As Petite
Jeanne I can live on. And no one will ever
know. I am&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">[50]</div>
<p>Her thoughts were interrupted, not by a
sound nor a movement, but by a sudden great
silence that had fallen, like a star from the sky
at night, upon the assembled host of little
people.</p>
<p>Petite Jeanne was not a stranger to silence.
She had stood at the edge of a clearing before
an abandoned cabin, far from the home of any
living man just as the stars were coming out,
when a hush had fallen over all; not a leaf had
stirred, not a bird note had sounded, and the
living, breathing world had seemed far away.
She had called that silence.</p>
<p>She had drifted with idle paddle in a canoe
far out upon the glimmering surface of Lake
Huron. There, alone, with night falling, she
had listened until every tiniest wavelet had
gone to rest. She had heard the throb of a motor
die away in the distance. She had felt
rather than heard the breath of air stirred by
the last lone seagull on his way to some rocky
ledge for rest. She had at last listened for the
faintest sound, then had whispered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is silence.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">[51]</div>
<p>It may have been, but never had a silence
impressed her as did the silence of this moment
as, seated there on the floor, far from her
friends, an uninvited guest to some weird ceremony,
she awaited with bated breath that
which was to come.</p>
<p>She had not long to wait. A long tremulous
sigh, like the tide sweeping across the ocean
at night, passed over the motionless throng;
a sigh, that was all.</p>
<p>But Petite Jeanne? She wished to scream,
to rise and dash out of the room crying, &ldquo;Fire!
Fire!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did not scream. Something held her
back. Perhaps it was the sigh, and perhaps the
silence.</p>
<p>The thing that was happening was weird in
the extreme. On the stage a curtain was slowly,
silently closing. No one was near to close
it. It appeared endowed with life. This was
not all. The curtain was aflame. Tongues of
fire darted up its folds. One expected this fire
to roar. It did not. Yet, as the little French
girl, with heart in throat and finger nails cutting
deep, sat there petrified, flames raced up
the curtain again and yet again. And all the
time, in great, graceful folds, it was gliding,
silently gliding from the right and the left.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">[52]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Soon it will close,&rdquo; she told herself. &ldquo;And
then&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Only one thought saved Jeanne from a
scream that would have betrayed her; not a
soul in that impassive throng had moved or
spoken. It was borne in upon her that here
was some form of magic which she did not
know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a magic curtain.&rdquo; These words, formed
by her lips were not so much as whispered.</p>
<p>But now from a dark corner of the stage a
figure appeared. A weird stooping figure he
was, clothed all in white. He moved toward
the curtain with slow, halting steps. He
seemed desirous of passing between the folds
of the curtain before the opening; yet a great
fear appeared to hold him back.</p>
<p>At this moment there came to Jeanne&rsquo;s mind
words from a very ancient book:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Draw not nigh hither. Put off thy shoes from
thy feet.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">[53]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The burning bush!&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;It
burned but was not consumed; a magic bush.
This is a magic curtain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Remove thy shoes.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>She seemed to hear someone repeat these
words.</p>
<p>Her hands went to her feet. They were fully
clad. A quick glance to right and left assured
her that not another person in the room wore
shoes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My shoes will betray me!&rdquo; Consternation
seized her. One look backward, a stealthy
creeping toward the soft-carpeted stair, another
stealthy move and she was on her way
out.</p>
<p>But would she make it? Her heart was in
her throat. A quarter of the way up she was
obliged to pause. She was suffocating with
fear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must be calm,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;I must!
I must!&rdquo; Of a sudden life seemed a thing of
solemn beauty. Somehow she must escape
that she might live on and on.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">[54]</div>
<p>Once again she was creeping upward. Did
a hand touch her foot? Was someone preparing
to seize her? With an effort, she looked
down. No one was following. Every eye was
glued upon the magic curtain. The curtain
was closed. The white-robed figure had vanished.
What had happened? Had he passed
through? Had the curtain consumed him?
She shuddered. Then, summoning all her
courage, she leaped up the stairs, glided silently
across the room above, and passed swiftly
on until she gained the open air.</p>
<p>Then how she sped away! Never had she
raced so swiftly and silently as now.</p>
<p>It was some time before she realized how
futile was her flight. No one pursued her.</p>
<p>In time she was able to still her wildly beating
heart. Then she turned toward home.</p>
<p>Once she stopped dead in her tracks to exclaim:
&ldquo;The magic curtain! Oh! Why did I
run away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, as another mood seized her, she redoubled
her pace. Florence, she hoped, awaited
her with a roaring fire, a cup of hot chocolate
and a good scolding.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">[55]</div>
<h2 id="c6"><br />CHAPTER VI
<br />THE WOMAN IN BLACK</h2>
<p>By the time she reached the doorway that
led to her humble abode, Petite Jeanne
was in high spirits. The brisk walk had stirred
her blood. Her recent adventure had quickened
her imagination. She was prepared for
anything.</p>
<p>Alas, how quickly all this vanished! One
moment she was a heroine marching forth to
face that which life might fling at her; the next
she was limp as a rag doll. Such was Petite
Jeanne. The cause?</p>
<p>The room she entered was dark; chill damp
hung over the place like a shroud. Florence
was not there. The fire was dead. Cheer had
passed from the place; gloom had come.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">[56]</div>
<p>Jeanne could build a fire. This is an art
known to all wanderers, and she had been a
gypsy. But she lacked the will to put her skill
to the test, so, quite in despair, she threw herself
in a chair and lay there, looking for all
the world like a deserted French doll, as she
whispered to herself:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can it matter? Life is without a true
purpose, all life. Why should one struggle?
Why not go down with the tide? Why&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But in one short moment all this was
changed. The door flew open. Florence burst
into the room and with her came a whole gust
of fresh lake air, or so it seemed to Jeanne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have been to the island!&rdquo; she exclaimed,
as she became a very animated doll.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I have been there.&rdquo; Excitement shone
from the big girl&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;And I have made a
surprising discovery. But wait. What ails the
fire?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jeanne shrugged. &ldquo;One does not know,&rdquo; she
murmured.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">[57]</div>
<p>Seizing the antiquated wood-hamper that
stood by the hearth, Florence piled shavings
and kindling high. Then, after scratching a
match, she watched the yellow flames spread
as shadows began dancing on the wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have been surrendering to gloom,&rdquo; she
said reprovingly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do it. It&rsquo;s bad for
you. Where there is light there is hope. And
see how our fire gleams!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You speak truth, my friend.&rdquo; Jeanne&rsquo;s tone
was solemn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But tell me.&rdquo; Her mood changed. &ldquo;You
have met adventure. So have I.&rdquo; Her eyes
shone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Florence was all business at once.
&ldquo;But take a look at the clock. There is just
time to rush out for a cup of tea, then&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I go to jail,&rdquo; replied Jeanne solemnly.
&ldquo;Tell me. What does one wear in jail?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are joking,&rdquo; Florence replied. &ldquo;This
is a serious affair. But, since you will go, it
will not help to be late. We must hurry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A moment later, arm in arm, they passed
from the outer door and the dull damp of night
swallowed them up.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">[58]</div>
<p>When, a short time later, Petite Jeanne,
garbed as Pierre Andrews, stole apprehensively
through the entrance to the great opera
house, her ever-fearful eyes fell upon two men
loitering just within.</p>
<p>The change that came over one of these, a
tall, dark young man with a steely eye, as he
caught sight of Jeanne was most astonishing.
Turning square about like some affair of metal
set on wheels, he appeared about to leap upon
her. Only a grip on his arm, that of his more
stocky companion, appeared to save the girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Watch out!&rdquo; the other counseled savagely.
&ldquo;Think where you are!&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the instant the look in those steely eyes
changed. The man became a smiling wolf.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey there, boy!&rdquo; he called to Jeanne.</p>
<p>But Jeanne, in her immaculate suit of black,
gave but one frightened backward look, and
then sped for the elevator.</p>
<p>Her heart was doing double time as she saw
the elevator door silently close.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who could that man be?&rdquo; she questioned
herself breathlessly. &ldquo;He can&rsquo;t have been a
detective. They do not stand on ceremony. He
would be here by my side, with a hand on my
arm. But if not a detective, what then?&rdquo; She
could form no answer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">[59]</div>
<p>In the meantime, the dark, slim man was
saying to the stocky one:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you beat it? You can&rsquo;t! Thought he&rsquo;d
cut for good! My luck. But no! Here he is,
going back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you care?&rdquo; the other grumbled.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll take him, and that&rsquo;s the end of it.
Come on outside.&rdquo; His eyes strayed to the
corner. A deep-chested man whose coat bulged
in a strange way was loitering there. &ldquo;Air&rsquo;s
bad in here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They passed out into the night. And there
we leave them. But not for long. Men such as
these are found in curious places and at unheard-of
hours.</p>
<p>But Jeanne? With her heart stilled for a
brief period of time, she rose to the floor above,
only to be thrown into a state of mind bordering
on hysteria at thought of facing the ordeal
that must lie just before her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">[60]</div>
<p>Seeking a dark corner, she closed her
eyes. Allowing her head to drop forward, she
stood like one in prayer. Did she pray, or did
she but surrender her soul and body to the
forces of nature all about her? Who can say
but that these two are the same, or at least
that their effect is the same? However that
may be, it was a changed Jeanne who, three
minutes later, took up her post of duty in the
boxes, for hers was the air of a sentry. Her
movements were firm and steady, the look
upon her face as calm as the reflection of the
moon upon a still pool at midnight.</p>
<p>That which followed was silent drama.
Throughout it all, not a word was spoken, no,
not so much as whispered. The effect was like
a thing of magic. Jeanne will never erase those
pictures from her memory.</p>
<p>Scarcely had she taken her place at the door
leading to the box than the great magnate,
J. Rufus Robinson, and his daughter, she of
the lost pearls, appeared. Jeanne caught her
breath as she beheld the cape of green velvet
trimmed with white fur and the matchless
French gown of cream colored silk she wore.
There was no lack of jewels despite the lost
pearls. A diamond flashed here, a ruby burned
there, yet they did not outshine the smile of
this child of the rich.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">[61]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I am seeing life,&rdquo; Jeanne whispered to herself.
&ldquo;I must see more of it. I must! I just
must!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yet, even as she whispered these words she
thought of the bearded man with those luminous
eyes. She had asked him if all this was
life&mdash;this wealth, this pomp and circumstance.
And he had replied quite calmly: &ldquo;It is a
form of life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that instant Jeanne thought of impending
events that hung over her like a sword suspended
by a hair, and shuddered.</p>
<p>Assisting the millionaire&rsquo;s daughter to remove
her wrap, she carried it to the cloak-room
at the back, then assisted the pair to arrange
their chairs. This done, she stepped
back, a respectful distance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">[62]</div>
<p>While this was being done, a man, gliding
forward with silent unconcern, had taken a
place in the shadows at the back of the box.
Deeper in the shadows stood a woman in
black. Jeanne did not see the woman. She did
see the man, and shuddered again. He, she
realized, was the detective.</p>
<p>As she turned her back, the detective moved,
prepared without doubt to advance upon her.
But a curious thing happened. The woman in
the shadows darted forward. Touching the
arm of the rich young lady, she pointed at
Jeanne and nodded her head. The girl in turn
looked at the detective and shook her head.
Then both the detective and the woman in
black lost themselves in the shadows at the
back of the box.</p>
<p>All this was lost to Jeanne. Her back had
been turned. Her mind had been filled by a
magic panorama, a picture of that which was
to pass across the opera stage that night. Thus
does devotion to a great art cause us to forget
the deepest, darkest trouble in our lives.</p>
<p>All during that long evening Petite Jeanne
found herself profoundly puzzled. Why was
nothing said to her regarding the pearls? Why
was she not arrested?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">[63]</div>
<p>&ldquo;They have been found,&rdquo; she told herself at
last. Yet she doubted her own words, as well
she might.</p>
<p>Two incidents of the evening impressed her.
As she left the box during an intermission the
rich girl turned a bright smile full upon her as
she said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Caught off her guard, the little French girl
barely escaped betraying her secret. The first
sound of &ldquo;Jeanne&rdquo; was upon her lips when of
a sudden, without so much as a stammer or
blush, she answered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pierre Andrews, if you please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a romantic name.&rdquo; The girl smiled
again, then passed on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now why did she do that?&rdquo; Jeanne&rsquo;s head
was in a whirl.</p>
<p>Scarcely had she regained her composure
when a voice behind her asked: &ldquo;Are you fond
of the opera?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes! Yes, indeed I am.&rdquo; She turned
about.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">[64]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then you may see much of it this season.&rdquo;
The mysterious woman in black was already
turned about. She was walking away. Jeanne
did not see her face, yet there was that about
her voice, a depth, a melodious resonance, a
something, that thrilled her to the very tips
of her slender toes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will wonders never end?&rdquo; she asked herself,
and found no answer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">[65]</div>
<h2 id="c7"><br />CHAPTER VII
<br />DREAMS OF OTHER DAYS</h2>
<p>Petite Jeanne left the opera house
that night in a brown study. She was
perplexed beyond words. The necklace had
not been found. She had made sure of that
when, between the second and third act, she
had discovered on a bulletin board of the lobby
a typewritten notice of the loss and an offer
of a reward for the return of the pearls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the pearls had been found that notice
would have been taken down,&rdquo; she assured
herself. &ldquo;But if this is true, why did I go unmolested?
One would suppose that at least
I would be questioned regarding the affair.
But no!&rdquo; She shrugged her graceful shoulders.
&ldquo;They ask me nothing. They look and look,
and say nothing. Oh, yes, indeed, they say:
&lsquo;What is your name?&rsquo; That most beautiful rich
one, she says this. And the dark one who is
only a voice, she says: &lsquo;Do you like the opera?&rsquo;
She asks this. And who is she? I know that
voice. I have heard it before. It is very familiar,
yet I cannot recall it. If she is here
again I shall see her face.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">[66]</div>
<p>Having thus worked herself into a state of
deep perplexity that rapidly ripened into fear,
she glided, once her duties were done, down a
narrow aisle, across the end of the stage where
a score of stage hands were busy shifting
scenes, then along a narrow passage-way, with
which, as you will know from reading <i>The
Golden Circle</i>, she was thoroughly familiar.
From this passageway she emerged upon a
second and narrower stage.</p>
<p>This was the stage of the Civic Theatre.
The stage was dark. The house was dark.
Only the faintest gleam of light revealed seats
like ghosts ranged row on row.</p>
<p>How familiar it all seemed to her. The time
had been when, not many months back, she
had stood upon that stage and by the aid of
her God-given gift, had stirred the audience
to admiration, to laughter and to tears.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">[67]</div>
<p>As she stood there now a wave of feeling
came over her that she could not resist. This
stage, this little playhouse had become to her
what home means to many. The people who
had haunted those seats were <i>her</i> people. They
had loved her. She had loved them. But now
they were gone. The house was dark, the light
opera troop was scattered. She thought she
knew how a mother robin must feel as she visits
her nest long after the fledglings have
flown.</p>
<p>Advancing to the center of the stage, she
stretched her arms wide in mute appeal to the
empty seats. But no least whisper of admiration
or disapproval came back to her.</p>
<p>A moment she stood thus. Then, as her
hands dropped, her breast heaved with one
great sob.</p>
<p>But, like the sea, Jeanne was made of many
moods. &ldquo;No! No!&rdquo; She stamped her small
foot. &ldquo;I will not come back to this! I will not!
The way back is closed. Only the door ahead
is open. I will go on.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">[68]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Grand Opera, this is all now. This is art
indeed. Pictures, music, story. This is Grand
Opera. Big! Grand! Noble! Some day, somehow
I shall stand upon that most wonderful
of all stages, and those people, those thousands,
the richest, the most learned, the most
noble, they shall be my people!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having delivered this speech to the deserted
hall, she once again became a very little lady
in a trim black dress suit, seeking a way to
the outer air and the street that led to home.</p>
<p>She had come this way because she feared
that the slender, dark-faced stranger who had
accosted her earlier in the evening would
await her at the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he sees me he will follow,&rdquo; she told herself.
&ldquo;And then&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She finished with a shudder.</p>
<p>In choosing this way she had counted upon
one circumstance. Nor had she counted in
vain. As she hurried down the dark aisle
toward the back of the theatre which was, she
knew, closed, she came quite suddenly upon a
man with a flashlight and time clock.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">[69]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Tommy Mosk!&rdquo; she exclaimed in a
whisper. &ldquo;How glad I am that you are still
here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The watchman threw his light upon her
face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Petite Jeanne!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;But why
the masquerade?&rdquo; Tommy belonged to those
other days and, with the rest, had come to love
the simple, big-hearted little light opera star.
&ldquo;Petite Jeanne! But why&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t make me tell.&rdquo; She gripped
his arm. &ldquo;Only let me out, and see me safe
into a taxi. And&mdash;and&mdash;&rdquo; She put a finger to
her lips. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t whisper a word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;it&rsquo;s irregular, but I&mdash;I&rsquo;ll do it,&rdquo; he replied
gallantly.</p>
<p>Jeanne gave his arm another squeeze and
they were away.</p>
<p>Three minutes later, still dressed as Pierre,
the usher, she was huddled on the broad seat
of a taxi, speeding for home.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">[70]</div>
<h2 id="c8"><br />CHAPTER VIII
<br />AN ISLAND MYSTERY</h2>
<p>When Florence, whose work as physical
director required her attention until
late hours three nights in the week, arrived,
she found the little French girl still dressed
as Pierre, curled up in a big chair shuddering
in the cold and the dark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wh-what&rsquo;s happened?&rdquo; She stared at her
companion in astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;N-n-nothing happened!&rdquo; wailed Petite
Jeanne. &ldquo;That is why I am so very much
afraid. They have said not one word to me
about the pearls. They believe I have them.
They will follow me, shadow me, search this
place. Who can doubt it? Oh, <i>mon Dieu</i>! Such
times! Such troubles!</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yes!&rdquo; she cried with a fresh shudder.
&ldquo;There is the slim, dark-faced one who is after
me. And how can I know why?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">[71]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You poor child!&rdquo; Florence lifted her from
the chair as easily as she might had she been
a sack of feathers. &ldquo;You shall tell me all about
it. But first I must make a fire and brew some
good black tea. And you must run along and
become Petite Jeanne. I am not very fond of
this Pierre person.&rdquo; She plucked at the black
coat sleeve. &ldquo;In fact I never have cared for
him at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Half an hour later the two girls were curled
up amid a pile of rugs and cushions before the
fire. Cups were steaming, the fire crackling
and the day, such as it had been, was rapidly
passing into the joyous realm of &ldquo;times that
are gone,&rdquo; where one may live in memories
that amuse and thrill, but never cause fear nor
pain.</p>
<p>Jeanne had told her story and Florence had
done her best to reassure her, when the little
French girl exclaimed: &ldquo;But you, my friend?
Only a few hours ago you spoke of a discovery
on the island. What was this so wonderful
thing you saw there?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">[72]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, now,&rdquo; Florence sat up to prod the
fire, &ldquo;that was the strangest thing! You have
been on the island?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, my friend. In the fort, but not on the
island.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you don&rsquo;t know what sort of half
wild place it is. It&rsquo;s made of the dumping from
a great city: cans, broken bricks, clay, everything.
And from sand taken from the bottom
of the lake. It&rsquo;s been years in the making.
Storms have washed in seeds. Birds have carried
in others. Little forests of willow and cottonwood
have sprung up. The south end is a
jungle. A fit hide-out for tramps, you&rsquo;d say.
All that. You&rsquo;d not expect to find respectable
people living there, would you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how could they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the queer part. They could. And
I&rsquo;m almost sure they do. Seems too strange
to be true.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">[73]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And yet&mdash;&rdquo; She prodded the fire, then
stared into the flames as if to see reproduced
there pictures that had half faded from her
memories. &ldquo;And yet, Petite Jeanne, I saw a
girl out there, quite a young girl, in overalls
and a bathing-suit. She was like a statue when
I first saw her, a living statue. She went in for
a dip, then donned her overalls to dash right
into the jungle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wanted to see where she went, so I followed.
And what do you think! After following
a winding trail for a little time, I came,
just where the cottonwoods are tallest, upon
the strangest sort of dwelling&mdash;if it was a
dwelling at all&mdash;I have ever seen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was it like?&rdquo; Jeanne leaned eagerly
forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like nothing on land or sea, but a little
akin to both. The door was heavy and without
glass. It had a great brass knob such as you
find on the cabin doors of very old ships. And
the windows, if you might call them that,
looked like portholes taken from ships.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the walls; they were strangest of all.
Curious curved pillars rose every two or three
feet apart, to a considerable height. Between
these pillars brick walls had been built. The
whole was topped by a roof of green tile.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the girl went in there?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">[74]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Where else could she have gone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that was her home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who could doubt it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;America&mdash;&rdquo; Jeanne drew a long breath.
&ldquo;Your America is a strange place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So strange that even we who have lived
here always are constantly running into the
most astonishing things.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; the big girl added, after a brief
silence, &ldquo;that is why America is such a glorious
place to live.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But did you not endeavor to make a call at
this strange home?&rdquo; asked Jeanne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did. Little good it did me! I knocked
three times at the door. There was no answer.
It was growing dark, but no light shone from
those porthole windows. So all I could do was
to retrace my steps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had gone not a dozen paces when I caught
the sound of a half suppressed laugh.
I wheeled about, but saw no one. Now, what
do you make of that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a sweet and jolly mystery,&rdquo; said
Jeanne. &ldquo;We shall solve it, you and I.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">[75]</div>
<p>And in dreaming of this new and apparently
harmless adventure, the little French girl&rsquo;s
troubles were, for the time being at least, forgotten.
She slept soundly that night and all
her dreams were dreams of peace.</p>
<p>But to-morrow was another day.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">[76]</div>
<h2 id="c9"><br />CHAPTER IX
<br />CAUGHT IN THE ACT</h2>
<p>And on that new day, like a ray of sunshine
breaking through the clouds after
a storm, there came to Jeanne an hour of
speechless joy.</p>
<p>Having exercised as ever her gift of friendship
to all mankind, she was able, through her
acquaintance with the watchman, to enter the
opera house when she chose. There was only
one drawback to this; she must enter always
as Pierre and never as Petite Jeanne.</p>
<p>Knowing that some sort of rehearsal would
be in progress, she garbed herself in her Pierre
costume and repaired to the place which to
her, of all places on earth, seemed the home of
pure enchantment&mdash;the opera.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">[77]</div>
<p>Even now, when the seats were clothed like
ghosts in white sheets, when the aisles, so
often adorned with living models all a-glitter
with silks and jewels, and echoing with the
sound of applause and laughter, were dark and
still, the great hall lost none of its charm.</p>
<p>As she tripped noiselessly down the foyer
where pillars cut from some curious stone
flanked her on every side and priceless chandeliers
hung like blind ghosts far above her head,
she thought of the hundreds who had promenaded
here displaying rich furs, costly silks
and jewels. She recalled, too, the remark of
that strangely studious man with a beard:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a form of life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder what he meant?&rdquo; she said half
aloud. &ldquo;Perhaps some day I shall meet him
again. If I do, I shall ask him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Jeanne was no person to be living in the
past. She dreamed of the future when only
dreams were at her command. For her the
vivid, living, all-entrancing <i>present</i> was what
mattered most. She had not haunted the building
long before she might have been found
curled up in a seat among the dark shadows
close to the back row on the orchestra floor.
She had pushed the white covering away, but
was still half hidden by it; she could be entirely
hidden in a second&rsquo;s time if she so willed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">[78]</div>
<p>Behind and above her, black chasms of darkness,
the boxes and balconies loomed. Before
her the stage, all dark, seemed a mysterious
cave where a hundred bandits might hide
among the settings of some imposing scene.</p>
<p>She did not know the name of the opera to
be rehearsed on this particular afternoon.
Who, then, can describe the stirring of her
blood, the quickening of her heart-beats, the
thrill that coursed through her very being
when the first faint flush of dawn began appearing
upon the scene that lay before her?
A stage dawn it was, to be sure; but very little
less than real it was, for all that. In this
matchless place of amusement shades of light,
pale gray, blue, rosy red, all come creeping
out, and dawn lingers as it does upon hills and
forests of earth and stone and wood.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">[79]</div>
<p>Eagerly the little French girl leaned forward
to catch the first glimpse of that unknown
scene. Slowly, slowly, but quite surely,
to the right a building began looming out
from that darkness. The trunk of a tree appeared,
another and yet another. Dimly a
street was outlined. One by one these objects
took on a clearer line until with an impulsive
movement, Jeanne fairly leaped from her
place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is France!&rdquo; she all but cried aloud. &ldquo;My
own beloved France! And the opera! It is to
be &lsquo;The Juggler of Notre Dame&rsquo;! Was there
ever such marvelous good fortune!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was indeed as if a will higher than her
own had planned all this, for this short opera
was the one Jeanne had studied. It was this
opera, as you will remember from reading <i>The
Golden Circle</i>, that Jeanne had once witnessed
quite by chance as she lay flat upon the iron
grating more than a hundred feet above the
stage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now I shall see Marjory Dean play in
it once more,&rdquo; she exulted. &ldquo;For this is a dress
rehearsal, I am sure of that.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">[80]</div>
<p>She was not long in discovering that her
words were true. Scarcely had the full light
of day shone upon that charming stage village,
nestled among the hills of France, than a company
of peasants, men, women and children,
all garbed in bright holiday attire, came trooping
upon the stage.</p>
<p>But what was this? Scarcely had they arrived
than one who loitered behind began
shouting in the most excited manner and
pointing to the road that led back to the hills.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The juggler is coming,&rdquo; Jeanne breathed.
&ldquo;The juggler of Notre Dame.&rdquo; She did not
say Marjory Dean, who played the part. She
said: &ldquo;the juggler,&rdquo; because at this moment
she lived again in that beautiful village of her
native land. Once again she was a gypsy child.
Once more she camped at the roadside. With
her pet bear and her friend, the juggler, she
marched proudly into the village to dance for
pennies before the delighted crowd in the village
square.</p>
<p>What wonder that Petite Jeanne knew every
word of this charming opera by heart? Was
it not France as she knew it? And was not
France her native land?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">[81]</div>
<p>Breathing deeply, clutching now and then
at her heart to still its wild beating, she waited
and watched. A second peasant girl followed
the first to the roadside. She too called and
beckoned. Others followed her. And then,
with a burst of joyous song, their gay garments
gleaming like a bed of flowers, their
faces shining, these happy villagers came
trooping back. And in their midst, bearing in
one hand a gay, colored hoop, in the other a
mysterious bag of tricks, was the juggler of
Notre Dame.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is Marjory Dean, Marjory herself. She
is the juggler,&rdquo; Jeanne whispered. She dared
not trust herself to do more. She wanted to
leap to her feet, to clap her hands and cry:
&ldquo;Ray! Ray! Ray! <i>Vive! Vive! Vive!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>But no, this would spoil it all. She must see
this beautiful story through to its end.</p>
<p>So, calming herself, she settled back to see
the juggler, arrayed in his fantastic costume,
open his bag of tricks. She saw him delight
his audience with his simple artistry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">[82]</div>
<p>She watched, breathless, as a priest, coming
from the monastery, rebuked him for practicing
what he believed to be a sinful art. She
suffered with the juggler as he fought a battle
with his soul. When he came near to the door
of the monastery that, being entered, might
never again be abandoned, she wished to rise
and shout:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! No! Juggler! Stay with the happy
people in the bright sunshine. Show them
more of your art. Life is too often sad. Bring
joy to their lives!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She said, in reality, nothing. When at last
the curtain fell, she was filled with one desire:
to be for one short hour the juggler of Notre
Dame. She knew the words of his song; had
practiced his simple tricks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not? Sometime&mdash;somewhere,&rdquo; she
breathed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometime? Somewhere?&rdquo; She realized in
an instant that no place could be quite the
same to her as this one that in all its glories
of green and gold surrounded her now.</p>
<p>When the curtain was up again the stage
scene remained the same; but the gay peasants,
the juggler, were gone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">[83]</div>
<p>After some moments of waiting Jeanne realized
that this scene had been set for the night&rsquo;s
performance, that this scene alone would be
rehearsed upon the stage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are gone! It is over!&rdquo; How empty
her life seemed now. It was as if a great light
had suddenly gone out.</p>
<p>Stealing from her place, she crept down the
aisle, entered a door and emerged at last upon
a dark corner of the stage.</p>
<p>For a moment, quite breathless, she stood
there in the shadows, watching, listening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no one,&rdquo; she breathed. &ldquo;I am
alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An overpowering desire seized her to don
the juggler&rsquo;s costume, to sing his songs, to do
his tricks. The costume was there, the bag of
tricks. Why not?</p>
<p>Pausing not a second, she crept to the center
of the stage, seized the coveted prizes, then
beat a hasty retreat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">[84]</div>
<p>Ten minutes later, dancing lightly and singing
softly, she came upon the stage. She was
there alone. Yet, in her mind&rsquo;s eye she saw
the villagers of France, matrons and men,
laughing lovers, dancing children, all before
her as, casting her bag upon the green, she
seized some trifling baubles and began working
her charms.</p>
<p>For her, too, the seats were not dark, covered
empties, but filled with human beings,
filled with the light and joy of living.</p>
<p>Of a sudden she seemed to hear the reproving
words of the priest.</p>
<p>Turning about, with sober face, she stood
before the monastery door.</p>
<p>And then, like some bird discovered in a
garden, she wanted to run away. For there,
in very life, a little way back upon the vast
stage, stood all the peasants of the opera. And
in their midst, garbed in street attire, was
Marjory Dean!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you? How do you dare tamper
with my property, to put on my costume?&rdquo;
Marjory Dean advanced alone.</p>
<p>There was sternness in her tone. But there
was another quality besides. Had it not been
for this, Jeanne might have crumpled in a helpless
heap upon the stage. As it was, she could
only murmur in her humblest manner:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">[85]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I am only an usher. See!&rdquo; She stripped
off the juggler&rsquo;s garb, and stood there in black
attire. &ldquo;Please do not be too hard. I have
harmed nothing. See! I will put it all back.&rdquo;
This, with trembling fingers, she proceeded to
do. Then in the midst of profound silence, she
retreated into the shadows.</p>
<p>She had barely escaped from the stage into
the darkness of the opera pit when a figure
came soft-footedly after her.</p>
<p>She wished to flee, but a voice seemed to
whisper, &ldquo;Stay!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The word that came ten seconds after was,
&ldquo;Wait! You can&rsquo;t deceive me. You are Petite
Jeanne!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the great one, Marjory Dean, who
spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, how&mdash;how could you know?&rdquo; Jeanne
was thrown into consternation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who could not know? If one has seen you
upon the stage before, he could not be mistaken.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">[86]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But, little girl,&rdquo; the great one&rsquo;s tone was
deep and low like the mellow chimes of a great
clock, &ldquo;I will not betray you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did that divinely, Petite Jeanne. I
could not have done it better. And you,
Jeanne, are much like me. A little make-up,
and there you are, Petite Jeanne, who is Marjory
Dean. Some day, perhaps, I shall allow
you to take my place, to do this first act for
me, before all this.&rdquo; She spread her arms wide
as if to take in a vast audience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Jeanne protested. &ldquo;I could never do
that. Never! Marjory Dean, I&mdash;no! No!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She broke off to stare into the darkness. No
one was there!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could almost believe I imagined it,&rdquo; she
told herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet&mdash;no! It was true. She said it.
Marjory Dean said that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Little wonder, then, that all the remaining
hours of that day found on her fair face a radiance
born, one might say, in Heaven.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">[87]</div>
<p>Many saw that face and were charmed by
it. The little rich girl saw it as Jeanne performed
her humble duties as Pierre. She was
so taken by it that, with her father&rsquo;s consent,
she invited Pierre to visit her at her father&rsquo;s
estate next day. And Pierre accepted. And
that, as you well may guess, leads to quite another
story.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">[88]</div>
<h2 id="c10"><br />CHAPTER X
<br />THE ONE WITHIN THE SHADOWS</h2>
<p>Having accepted an invitation from a
daughter of the rich, Jeanne was at once
thrown into consternation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What am I to wear?&rdquo; she wailed. &ldquo;As
Pierre I can&rsquo;t very well wear pink chiffon and
satin slippers. And of course evening dress
does not go with an informal visit to an estate
in mid-afternoon. Oh, why did I accept?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You accepted,&rdquo; Florence replied quietly,
&ldquo;because you wish to know all about life. You
have been poor as a gypsy. You know all
about being poor. You have lived as a successful
lady of the stage. You were then an
artist. Successful artists are middle class people,
I should say. But your friend Rosemary
is rich. She will show you one more side of
life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A form of life, that&rsquo;s what he called it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">[89]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Who called it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A man. But what am I to wear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Florence pondered, &ldquo;you are a
youth, a mere boy; that&rsquo;s the way they think
of you. You are to tramp about over the estate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And ride horses. She said so. How I love
horses!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a boy. And you have no mother
to guide you.&rdquo; Florence chanted this. &ldquo;What
would a boy wear? Knickers, a waist, heavy
shoes, a cap. You have all these, left from our
summer in the northern woods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Why not, indeed? This was agreed upon at
once. So it happened that when the great car,
all a-glitter with gold and platinum trimmings,
met her before the opera at the appointed
hour, it was as a boy, perhaps in middle
teens, garbed for an outing, that the little
French girl sank deep into the broadcloth
cushions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Florence said it would do,&rdquo; she told herself.
&ldquo;She is usually right. I do hope that she
may be right this time.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">[90]</div>
<p>Rosemary Robinson had been well trained,
very well trained indeed. The ladies who managed
and taught the private school which she
attended were ladies of the first magnitude.
As everyone knows, the first lesson to be
learned in the school of proper training is the
art of deception. One must learn to conceal
one&rsquo;s feelings. Rosemary had learned this lesson
well. It had been a costly lesson. To any
person endowed with a frank and generous
nature, such a lesson comes only by diligence
and suffering. If she had expected to find the
youthful Pierre dressed in other garments
than white waist, knickers and green cap, she
did not say so, either by word, look or gesture.</p>
<p>This put Jeanne at her ease at once; at least
as much at ease as any girl masquerading as
a boy might be expected to achieve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a dear,&rdquo; she thought to herself as
Rosemary, leading her into the house, introduced
her in the most nonchalant manner to
the greatest earthly paradise she had ever
known.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">[91]</div>
<p>As she felt her feet sink deep in rich Oriental
rugs, as her eyes feasted themselves upon oil
paintings, tapestries and rare bits of statuary
that had been gathered from every corner of
the globe, she could not so much as regret the
deception that had gained her entrance to this
world of rare treasures.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But would I wish to live here?&rdquo; she asked
herself. &ldquo;It is like living in a museum.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When she had entered Rosemary&rsquo;s own little
personal study, when she had feasted her
eyes upon all the small objects of rare charm
that were Rosemary&rsquo;s own, upon the furniture
done by master craftsmen and the interior
decorated by a real artist, when she had
touched the soft creations of silk that were
curtains, drapes and pillows, she murmured:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Here is that which would bring happiness
to any soul who loves beauty and knows
it when he sees it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we must not remain indoors on a day
such as this!&rdquo; Rosemary exclaimed. &ldquo;Come!&rdquo;
She seized her new friend&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;We will
go out into the sunshine. You are a sun worshipper,
are you not?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">[92]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; said Jeanne who, you must not
forget, was for the day Pierre Andrews. &ldquo;I
truly do not know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are many sun worshippers these
days.&rdquo; Rosemary laughed a merry laugh.
&ldquo;And why not? Does not the sun give us life?
And if we rest beneath his rays much of the
time, does he not give us a more abundant
life?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See!&rdquo; Pierre, catching the spirit of the
hour, held out a bare arm as brown as the dead
leaves of October. &ldquo;I <i>am</i> a sun worshipper!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this they went dancing down the hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, see!&rdquo; Rosemary exclaimed. &ldquo;Here is
the organ!&rdquo; She threw open a door, sprang
to a bench, touched a switch here, a stop there,
then began sending out peals of sweet, low,
melodious music.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A pipe organ!&rdquo; Jeanne exclaimed. &ldquo;In your
home!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">[93]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; Rosemary laughed. &ldquo;Father
likes the organ. Why should he not hear it
when he chooses? It is a very fine one. Many
of the great masters have been here to play
it. I am taking lessons. In half an hour I must
come here for a lesson. Then you must become
a sun worshipper. You may wander where
you please or just lie by the lily pond and
dream in the sun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am fond of dreaming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you shall dream.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The grounds surrounding the great house
were to the little French girl a land of enchantment.
The formal garden where even in
late autumn the rich colors of bright red, green
and gold vied with the glory of the Indian
Summer sunshine, the rock garden, the pool
where gold-fish swam, the rustic bridge across
the brook, and back of all this the primeval
forest of oak, walnut and maple; all this, as
they wandered over leaf-strewn paths, reminded
her of the forests and hedges, the grounds
and gardens of her own beloved France.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Truly,&rdquo; she whispered to herself, &ldquo;all this
is worth being rich for.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what a pity&mdash;&rdquo; Her mood changed.
&ldquo;What a pity that it may not belong to all&mdash;to
the middle class, the poor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">[94]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; she concluded philosophically,
&ldquo;they have the parks. Truly they are beautiful
always.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was beside a broad pool where lily pads
lay upon placid waters that Jeanne at last
found a place of repose beneath the mellow
autumn sun, to settle down to the business of
doing her bit of sun worship.</p>
<p>It was truly delightful, this spot, and very
dreamy. There were broad stretches of water
between the clusters of lily pads. In these,
three stately swans, seeming royal floats of
some enchanted midget city, floated. Some
late flowers bloomed at her feet. Here bees
hummed drowsily. A dragon fly, last of his
race, a great green ship with bulging eyes,
darted here and there. Yet in his movements
there were suggestions of rest and dreamy repose.
The sun was warm. From the distance
came the drone of a pipe organ. It, too, spoke
of rest. Jeanne, as always, had retired at a
late hour on the previous night. Her head
nodded. She stretched herself out upon the
turf. She would close her eyes for three winks.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">[95]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Just three winks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the drowsy warmth, the distant melody,
the darting dragon fly, seen even in her
dreams, held her eyes tight closed.</p>
<p>As she dreamed, the bushes not five yards
away parted and a face peered forth. It was
not an inviting face. It was a dark, evil-eyed
face with a trembling leer about the mouth.
Jeanne had seen this man. He had called to
her. She had run away. That was long ago,
before the door of the opera. She did not see
him now. She slept.</p>
<p>A little bird scolding in a tree seemed eager
to wake her. She did not wake.</p>
<p>The man moved forward a step. Someone
unseen appeared to move behind him. With a
wolf-like eye he glanced to right and left. He
moved another step. He was like a cat creeping
upon his prey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wake up, Jeanne! Wake up! Wake!
Wake! Wake up!&rdquo; the little bird scolded on.
Jeanne did not stir. Still the sun gleamed
warm, the music droned, the dragon fly darted
in her dreams.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">[96]</div>
<p>But what is this? The evil-eyed one shrinks
back into his place of hiding. No footsteps are
heard; the grass is like a green carpet, as the
master of the estate and his wife approach.</p>
<p>They would have passed close to the sleeping
one had not a glance arrested them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a beautiful boy!&rdquo; whispered the lady.
&ldquo;And see how peacefully he sleeps! He is a
friend of Rosemary, a mere child of the opera.
She has taken a fancy to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who would not?&rdquo; the man rumbled low.
&ldquo;I have seen him at our box. There was the
affair of the pearls. He&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could a guilty person sleep so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not upon the estate of one he has robbed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely not. Do you know,&rdquo; the lady&rsquo;s tone
became deeply serious, &ldquo;I have often thought
of adopting such a child, a boy to be a companion
and brother to Rosemary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Could Jeanne have heard this she might well
have blushed. She did not hear, for the sun
shone on, the music still droned and the dragon
fly darted in her dreams.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">[97]</div>
<p>The lady looked in the great man&rsquo;s eyes.
She read an answer there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall we wake him and suggest it now?&rdquo;
she whispered.</p>
<p>Ah, Jeanne! What shall the answer be? You
are Pierre. You are Jeanne.</p>
<p>But the great man shakes his head. &ldquo;The
thing needs talking over. In a matter of so
grave importance one must look carefully before
one moves. We must consider.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the two pass on. And once again Jeanne
has escaped.</p>
<p>And now Rosemary comes racing down the
slope to discover her and to waken her by
tickling her nose with a swan&rsquo;s feather.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come!&rdquo; she exclaims, before Jeanne is half
conscious of her surroundings. &ldquo;We are off for
a canter over the bridle path!&rdquo; Seizing
Jeanne&rsquo;s hand, she drags her to her feet. Then
together they go racing away toward the
stables.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">[98]</div>
<p>The remainder of that day was one joyous
interlude in Petite Jeanne&rsquo;s not uneventful life.
Save for the thought that Rosemary believed
her a boy, played with her and entertained
her as a boy and was, perhaps, just a little interested
in her as a boy, no flaw could be found
in this glorious occasion.</p>
<p>A great lover of horses since her days in
horse-drawn gypsy vans, she gloried in the
spirited brown steed she rode. The day was
perfect. Blue skies with fleecy clouds drifting
like sheep in a field, autumn leaves fluttering
down, cobwebs floating lazily across the fields;
this was autumn at its best.</p>
<p>They rode, those two, across green meadows,
down shady lanes, through forests where
shadows were deep. Now and again Rosemary
turned an admiring glance upon her companion
sitting in her saddle with ease and riding
with such grace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If she knew!&rdquo; Jeanne thought with a bitter-sweet
smile. &ldquo;If she only knew!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you learn to ride so well?&rdquo; Rosemary
asked, as they alighted and went in to
tea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In France, to be sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And who taught you?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">[99]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Who but the gypsies?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gypsies! How romantic!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Romantic? Yes, perhaps.&rdquo; Jeanne was
quick to change the subject. She was getting
into deep water. Should she begin telling of
her early life she must surely, sooner or later,
betray her secret.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rich people,&rdquo; she thought, as she journeyed
homeward in the great car when the
day was done, &ldquo;they are very much like others,
except when they choose to show off. And I
wonder how much they enjoy that, after all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Rosemary! Does she suspect? I wonder!
She&rsquo;s such a peach! It&rsquo;s a shame to deceive
her. Yet, what sport! And besides, I&rsquo;m
getting a little of what I want, a whole big lot,
I guess.&rdquo; She was thinking once more of Marjory
Dean&rsquo;s half-promise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will she truly allow me to be her understudy,
to go on in her place when the &lsquo;Juggler&rsquo;
is done again?&rdquo; She was fairly smothered by
the thought; yet she dared to hope&mdash;a little.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">[100]</div>
<h2 id="c11"><br />CHAPTER XI
<br />A DANCE FOR THE SPIRITS</h2>
<p>When Jeanne arrived at the rooms late
that night, after her evening among
the opera boxes, she found a half burned out
fire in the grate and a rather amusing note
from Florence on the table:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am asleep. Do not disturb me.&rdquo; This is
how the note ran.</p>
<p>She read the note and smiled. &ldquo;Poor, dear,
big Florence,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;How selfish
I am! She works hard. Often she needs rest
that she does not get. Yet I am always hoping
that she will be here to greet me and to cheer
me with jolly chatter and something warm
to drink.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still in this thoughtful mood, she entered
her chamber. She did not switch on the light
at once, but stood looking out of the window.
Somewhat to her surprise, she saw a dark figure
lurking in the shadows across the street.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">[101]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Who could it be?&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
<p>She had little hope of solving this problem
when an automobile light solved it for her and
gave her a shock besides. The light fell full
upon the man&rsquo;s face. She recognized him instantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jaeger!&rdquo; She said the name out loud and
trembled from head to foot.</p>
<p>Jaeger was the detective who haunted the
boxes at the opera.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is shadowing me!&rdquo; She could not doubt
this. &ldquo;He believes I stole those pearls. Perhaps
he thinks he can catch me trying them
on. Not much chance of that.&rdquo; She laughed
uneasily. &ldquo;It is well enough to know you are
innocent; but to convince others, that is the
problem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She thought of the lady in black. &ldquo;If only I
could see her, speak to her!&rdquo; She drew the
shades, threw on the light and disrobed, still
in a thoughtful mood. She was remembering
the voice of that lady.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">[102]</div>
<p>There was something hauntingly familiar
about that voice. It brought to her mind a
feeling of forests and rippling waters, the scent
of balsam and the song of birds. Yet she could
not tell where she had heard it before.</p>
<p>Joan of Arc was Jeanne&rsquo;s idol. Once as a
child, wandering with the gypsies, she had
slept within the shadows of the church where
Joan received her visions. At another time she
had sat for an entire forenoon dreaming the
hours away in the chamber that had once been
Joan&rsquo;s own. Yet, unlike Joan, she did not love
wearing the clothes of a boy. She was fond
of soft, clinging, silky things, was this delicate
French child. So, dressed in the silkiest of all
silks and the softest of satin robes, she built
herself a veritable mountain of pillows before
the fire and, sinking back into that soft depth,
proceeded to think things through.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">[103]</div>
<p>To this strange girl sitting at the mouth of
her cave made of pillows, the fire on the hearth
was a magic fire. She prodded it. As it blazed
red, she saw in it clearly the magic curtain.
She felt again the thrill of this mysterious
discovery. Once more she was gazing upon
strange smoking images, bronze eagles,
giants&rsquo; heads, dragons. She smelled the curious,
choking incense. And again the feeling
of wild terror seized her.</p>
<p>So real was the vision that she leaped to her
feet, sending the soft walls of her cave flying
in every direction.</p>
<p>Next instant she was in complete possession
of her senses. &ldquo;Why am I afraid?&rdquo; she asked
herself. &ldquo;Why was I afraid then? It is but a
stage setting, some Oriental magic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A thought struck her all of a heap. &ldquo;Stage
setting! That&rsquo;s it!&rdquo; she exclaimed in a low
whisper. &ldquo;Why not? What a wonderful setting
for some exotic little touch of Oriental
drama!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must return to that place. I must see that
Magic Curtain once more.&rdquo; She rearranged
the door to her cave. &ldquo;I must take someone
with me. Why not Marjory Dean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The thought pleased her. She mused over it
until the fire burned low.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">[104]</div>
<p>But with the dimming of the coals her spirits
ebbed. As she gazed into the fire she seemed
to see a dark and evil face leering at her, the
man who had called to her at the opera door.</p>
<p>Had she seen that same face staring at her
on that other occasion when she slept in the
sun on the Robinson estate, she might well
have shuddered more violently. As it was, she
asked but a single question: &ldquo;Who is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She threw on fuel. The fire flamed up. Once
more she was gay as she heard Marjory Dean
whisper those magic words:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did that divinely, Petite Jeanne. I
could not have done it better. Some day, perhaps,
I shall allow you to take my place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you?&rdquo; she cried, stretching her arms
wide. &ldquo;Oh! Will you, Marjory Dean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>After this emotional outburst she sat for a
long time quite motionless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; she mused after a time, &ldquo;why
this desire should have entered my heart. Why
Grand Opera? I have done Light Opera. I
sang. I danced. They applauded. They said
I was marvelous. Perhaps I was.&rdquo; Her head
fell a little forward.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">[105]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ambition!&rdquo; Her face was lifted to the ceiling.
&ldquo;It is ambition that drives us on. When
I was a child I danced in the country lanes.
Then I must go higher, I must dance in a
village; in a small city; in a large city; in Paris.
That so beautiful Paris! And now it must be
Grand Opera; something drives me on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She prodded the fire and, for the last time
that night, it flamed high.</p>
<p>Springing to her feet she cast off her satin
robe to go racing across the floor in the dance
of the juggler. Low and clear, her voice rose
in a French song of great enchantment. For
a time her delicate, elf-like form went weaving
in and out among the shadows cast by the fire.
Then, all of a sudden, she danced into her
chamber. The show, given only for spirits and
fairies, was at an end.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow,&rdquo; she whispered low, as her
eyes closed for sleep, &ldquo;to-morrow there is no
opera. I shall not see Marjory Dean, nor Rosemary,
nor those dark-faced ones who dog my
steps. To-morrow? Whom shall I see? What
strange new acquaintance shall I make; what
adventures come to me?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">[106]</div>
<h2 id="c12"><br />CHAPTER XII
<br />THE LOST CAMEO</h2>
<p>In spite of the fact that the Opera House was
dark on the following night, adventure
came to Petite Jeanne, adventure and excitement
a-plenty. It came like the sudden rush
of an ocean&rsquo;s wave. One moment she and
Florence were strolling in a leisurely manner
down the center of State Street; the next they
were surrounded, completely engulfed and
carried whither they knew not by a vast, restless,
roaring, surging sea of humanity.</p>
<p>For many days they had read accounts of
a great autumn festival that was to occur on
this night. Having never witnessed such a
fete, save in her native land, Petite Jeanne had
been eager to attend. So here they were. And
here, too, was an unbelievable multitude.</p>
<p>Petite Jeanne cast a startled look at her companion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">[107]</div>
<p>Florence, big capable Florence, smiled as she
bent over to speak in the little French girl&rsquo;s
ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get in front of me. I&rsquo;ll hold them back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why all this?&rdquo; Petite Jeanne tried to
gesture, only to end by prodding a fat man
in the stomach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; laughed Florence, &ldquo;is Harvest Jubilee
Night. A city of three million invited all
its citizens to come down and enjoy themselves
in six city blocks. Bands are to play. Radio
stars are to be seen. Living models will be
in all the store windows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The three million are here. They will hear
no bands. They will see no radio stars, nor
any living models either. They will see and
hear only themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">[108]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. And they will feel one another, too!&rdquo;
the little French girl cried, as the crush all but
pressed the breath from her lungs. The look
on her face was one of pure fright. Florence,
too, was thinking serious thoughts. That
which had promised only a bit of adventure
in the beginning bade fair to become a serious
matter. Having moved down the center of a
block, they had intended turning the corner.
But now, caught in the tremendous crush of
humanity, by the thousands upon thousands
of human beings who thronged the streets,
carried this way and that by currents and
counter-currents, they were likely to be carried
anywhere. And should the crush become
too great, they might well be rendered unconscious
by the vise-like pressure of the
throng.</p>
<p>This indeed was Harvest Jubilee Night. The
leading men of this city had made a great
mistake. Wishing to draw thousands of people
to the trading center of the city, they had
staged a great fete. As Florence had said, men
and women of note, actors, singers, radio stars
were to be found on grand stands erected at
every street crossing. All this was wonderful,
to be sure! Only one fact had been lost sight
of: that hundreds of thousands of people cannot
move about freely in the narrow space
of six city blocks.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">[109]</div>
<p>Now, here were the laughing, shouting,
crowding, groaning, weeping thousands.
What was to come of it all? Petite Jeanne
asked herself this question, took one long
quivering breath, then looked up at her stout
companion and was reassured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We came here for a lark,&rdquo; she told herself.
&ldquo;We must see it through.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I only hope,&rdquo; she caught her breath again,
&ldquo;that I don&rsquo;t see anyone in this crowd who
makes me trouble. Surely I cannot escape him
here!&rdquo; She was thinking of the dark-faced
man with the evil eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep up courage,&rdquo; Florence counseled.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll make it out of here safe enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But would they? Every second the situation
became more tense. Now they were carried
ten paces toward Wabash Avenue; now,
like some dance of death, the crowd surged
backward toward Dearborn Street. And now,
caught in an eddy, they whirled round and
round.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">[110]</div>
<p>In such a time as this the peril is great.
Always, certain persons, deserting all caution,
carried away by their own exuberance, render
confusion worse confounded. Bands of young
men, perhaps from high school or college, with
hands on shoulders, built up flying wedges
that shot through the crowd like bullets
through wood.</p>
<p>Just such a group was pressing upon the
stalwart Florence and all but crushing the
breath out of her, when for the first time she
became conscious of a little old lady in a faded
shawl who fairly crouched at her feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s eighty if a day,&rdquo; she thought, with
a sudden shock. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll be killed unless&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Petite Jeanne,&rdquo; she screamed, &ldquo;there are
times when human beings have neither eyes,
ears nor brains. They can always feel. You
have sharp elbows. Use them now to the glory
of God and for the life of this dear old lady in
her faded shawl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suiting actions to her own words, she kicked
forth lustily with her square-pointed athletic
shoe. The shoe made contact with a grinning
youth&rsquo;s shins. The look of joy on the youth&rsquo;s
face changed to one of sudden pain. He ceased
to shove and attempted a retreat. One more
grinning face was transformed by an elbow
thrust in the stomach. This one doubled up
and did his best to back away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">[111]</div>
<p>Jeanne added her bit. As Florence had said,
her elbows were sharp and effective.</p>
<p>In an incredibly short time there was space
for breathing. One moment the little old lady,
who was not five feet tall and did not weigh
ninety pounds, was in peril of her life; the next
she was caught in Florence&rsquo;s powerful arms
and was being borne to safety. And all the
time she was screaming:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Oh! Oh! It is gone! It is lost! It is
lost!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Florence agreed, as she dropped her
to the curbing, well out of the crush, &ldquo;you have
lost a shoe. But what&rsquo;s a shoe? You would
have lost your life. And, after all, how is one
to find a shoe in such a place of madness?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little old lady made no answer. She sat
down upon the curb and began silently to sob
while her slight body rocked from side to side
and her lips whispered words that could not
be heard.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">[112]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Was there ever such another night?&rdquo; Petite
Jeanne cried, in real distress. She was little
and quick, very emotional and quite French.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We came here for a gay time,&rdquo; she went
on. &ldquo;And now, see how it is! We have been
tossed about from wave to wave by the crowd,
which is a sea, and now it has washed us
ashore with a weeping old lady we have never
seen before and may never see again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; Florence touched her lips. &ldquo;You
will distress her. You came here to find joy
and happiness. Joy and happiness may be
found quite as often by serving others less fortunate
than ourselves as in any other way.
We will see if this is not true.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come!&rdquo; She placed gentle hands beneath
the bent form of the little, old lady on the
curb. &ldquo;Come, now. There is a bright little tea
room right over there. A good cup of black
tea will cheer you. Then you must tell us all
about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A look of puzzled uncertainty gave way to
a smile on the wrinkled face as this strange
derelict of the night murmured:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">[113]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Tea. Yes, yes, a good cup of black tea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tea room was all but deserted. On this
wild night of nights people did not eat. Vendors
of ice cream sandwiches found no customers.
Baskets of peanuts were more likely to
be tumbled into the street than eaten. The
throng had indeed become a wild, stormy sea.
And a stormy sea neither eats nor sleeps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; said Florence, as the hot tea
warmed the white-haired one&rsquo;s drowsy blood,
&ldquo;why did you weep at the loss of a shoe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A shoe?&rdquo; The little old lady seemed puzzled.
She looked down at her feet. &ldquo;A shoe?
Ah, yes! It is true. One shoe is gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it is not that.&rdquo; Her voice changed.
Her dull blue eyes took on fresh color. &ldquo;I
have lost more&mdash;much more. My purse!
Money? No, my children. A little. It is
nothing. I have lost my cameo, my only
treasure. And, oh, I shall never see it again!&rdquo;
She began wringing her hands and seemed
about to give way once more to weeping.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell us about it,&rdquo; Petite Jeanne put in
eagerly. &ldquo;Perhaps we can help you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">[114]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Tell you? Help me?&rdquo; The old eyes were
dreamy now. &ldquo;My cameo! My one great
treasure. It was made in Florence so many,
many years ago. It was my own portrait done
in onyx, pink onyx. I was only a child, sixteen,
slight and fair like you.&rdquo; She touched
Jeanne&rsquo;s golden hair. &ldquo;He was young, romantic,
already an artist. He became very
famous when he was older. But never, I am
sure, did he carve such a cameo, for, perhaps&mdash;perhaps
he loved me&mdash;just a little.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But now!&rdquo; This was a cry of pain. &ldquo;Now
it is gone! And I have kept it all these long
years. I should not have come to-night. I had
not been to the heart of the city for ten years.
But this night they told me I was to see &lsquo;Auld
Sandy&rsquo; himself. He&rsquo;s on the radio, you know.
He sings old Scotch songs so grandly and recites
Burns&rsquo; poems with so much feeling. I
wanted to see him. I did not dare leave the
cameo in my poor room. My cameo! So I
brought it, and now&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you said you would help me.&rdquo; Once
again her face brightened.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">[115]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Florence&rsquo;s tone was eager, hopeful.
&ldquo;We will help you. Someone will find your
purse. It will be turned in. The police will
have it. We will get it for you in the morning.
Only give us your address and we will bring
it, your treasure, your cameo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence heard that cry of joy, and her
heart smote her. Could they find it?</p>
<p>They wrote down the little old lady&rsquo;s address
carefully; then escorting her to the elevated
platform, they saw her safely aboard a
train.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now why did I do that?&rdquo; Florence turned
a face filled with consternation to Petite
Jeanne. &ldquo;Why did I promise so much?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was to wonder this many times during
that night of mysterious and thrilling adventure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us go back,&rdquo; said Petite Jeanne. &ldquo;See!
The trains are loaded with people returning
home. The crowd must not be so great. The
little lady&rsquo;s purse must have been kicked
about; but we may yet find it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">[116]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; replied Florence, &ldquo;would seem too
good to be true. Yes, let us go back. We must
not hope too much, for all that. Many are
going, but others are coming. Surely this is
one wild night in a great city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so it was. Hardly had they descended
the iron steps to the street and walked half a
block than the waves of humanity were upon
them again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The tide is set against us.&rdquo; Florence urged
her companion into the momentary security
of a department store entrance. There, from
a vantage point of safety, they watched the
crowds surging by. They were at a point
where the pressure of the throng was broken.
It was interesting to study the faces of those
who emerged into a place of comparative
quiet. Some were exuberant over the struggle
they had waged and won, others crushed.
Here was one in tears and there was one who
had fainted, being hurried away by others to
a place of first aid.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">[117]</div>
<p>&ldquo;They are poor,&rdquo; Petite Jeanne murmured.
&ldquo;At least they are not rich, nor even well-to-do.
They are working people who came for a
good time. Are they having it? Who can tell?
Surely, never before have they seen so many
people. And perhaps they never will see so
many again. To-morrow they will talk. How
they will talk of this night&rsquo;s adventure! As
for me,&rdquo; she sighed, &ldquo;I prefer a quiet place
beneath the stars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you?&rdquo; Florence spoke up quickly. &ldquo;Then
we will go to just such a place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely not in this great city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ten minutes by elevated train, ten minutes
walk after that, and we are there. Come! We
can never hope to reach the spot where the
cameo was lost. Come!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nor did she fail to make good her promise.
Twenty minutes later they were walking in a
spot where, save for the low swish of water
against rocks, silence reigned supreme.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How strange! How fascinating! What
stillness!&rdquo; Petite Jeanne gripped her companion&rsquo;s
arm hard. &ldquo;Here are silence, starlight,
moonlight, grass beneath one&rsquo;s feet and the
gleam of distant water in our eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">[118]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Florence&rsquo;s tone was low like the deep
notes of a cello. &ldquo;And only a short time ago,
perhaps a year ago, the waters of the lake lay
ten feet deep at the very spot on which we
stand. Such is the wondrous achievement of
man when inspired by a desire to provide a
quiet place for a weary multitude. This is
&lsquo;made land&rsquo; a park in the making. Great
squares of limestone were dumped in the lake.
With these as a barrier to hold back the onrush
of the lake waters, men have hauled in sand,
clay, ashes, all the refuse of a great city. Nature
has breathed upon that ugly pile of debris.
The sun has caressed it, the wind smoothed it,
rain beat down upon it, birds brought seeds,
and now we have soft earth, grass, flowers, a
place of beauty and quiet peace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The place they had entered is strange. A
great city, finding itself cramped for breathing
space, has reached out a mighty hand to snatch
land from the bottom of the lake. Thirty
blocks in length, as large as an ordinary farm,
this space promises to become, in the near future,
a place of joy forever.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">[119]</div>
<p>At the time of our story it was half a field
of tangled grass and half a junk pile. As the
two girls wandered on they found themselves
flanked on one side by a tumbled line of gigantic
man-made boulders and on the other by a
curious jumble of waste. Steel barrels, half
rusted away, lay among piles of cement blocks
and broken plaster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said Florence, &ldquo;let us go out upon
the rocks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A moment of unsteady leaping from spot to
spot, and they sat looking out on a band of
gold painted across the waters by the moon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How still it is!&rdquo; Jeanne whispered. &ldquo;After
all the shouting of the throng, I feel that I
may have gone suddenly deaf.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It <i>is</i> still,&rdquo; Florence replied. &ldquo;No one here.
Not a soul. Only you and I, the moon and the
night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And yet, even as she spoke, a sudden chill
gripped her heart. She had caught a sound.
Someone was among the rocks close at hand;
there could be no mistaking that. Who could
it be?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">[120]</div>
<p>Her heart misgave her. Had she committed
a dangerous blunder? She had been here before,
but never at night. The city, with all its
perils, its evil ones, was but a few steps away.
As she listened she even now caught indistinctly
the murmur of it. Someone was among
the rocks. He might be advancing. Who
could it be, at this hour of the night?</p>
<p>Strangely enough at this instant one
thought entered her mind: &ldquo;Nothing must
happen to me. I have a sacred duty to perform.
I have pledged myself to return that
priceless cameo to that dear little old lady.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the same instant the light from a distant
automobile, making a turn on the drive, fell
for a space of seconds upon the tumbled pile
of rocks. It lit up not alone the rocks but a
face; a strangely ugly face, not ten paces away.</p>
<p>One second the light was there. The next
it was gone. And in that same second the
moon went under a cloud. The place was utterly
dark.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">[121]</div>
<h2 id="c13"><br />CHAPTER XIII
<br />A NYMPH OF THE NIGHT</h2>
<p>Florence had never seen the face lit up
there in the night; yet it struck fear to
her heart. What must we say, then, of Petite
Jeanne? For this was the face of one who,
more than any others, inspired her with terror.
He it had been who called after her at the
door of the opera, he who had looked out from
the bushes as she slept in the sun. At sight
of him now, she all but fell among the rocks
from sheer panic.</p>
<p>As for Florence, she was startled into action.
They were, she suddenly realized, many
blocks from any human habitation, on a deserted
strip of man-made shore land lighted
only by stars and the moonlight. And at this
moment the moon, having failed them, had
left the place black as a tomb.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">[122]</div>
<p>With a low, whispered &ldquo;Come!&rdquo; and guided
more by instinct than sight, she led Jeanne off
the tumbled pile of rocks and out to the path
where grass grew rank and they were in danger
at any moment of tripping over pieces of
debris.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&mdash;who was that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence fancied she heard the little French
girl&rsquo;s heart beating wildly as she asked the
question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who can tell? There may be many. See!
Yonder, far ahead, is a light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The light they saw was the gleam of a camp
fire. In this desolate spot it seemed strangely
out of place; yet there is that about fire and
light that suggests security and peace. How
often in her homeland had Petite Jeanne felt
the cozy warmth of an open fireplace and, secure
from all danger, had fallen asleep in the
corner of a gypsy&rsquo;s tent. How often as a child
had Florence, in a cane-seated rocker, sat beside
the humble kitchen stove to hear the
crackle of the fire, to watch its glow through
its open grate and to dream dreams of security
and peace.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">[123]</div>
<p>What wonder, then, that these two bewildered
and frightened ones, at sight of a glowing
fire, should leap forward with cries of joy
on their lips?</p>
<p>Nor were they destined to disappointment.
The man who had built that fire loved its
cheerful gleam just as they did, and for the
very same reason: it whispered to him of security
and peace.</p>
<p>He was old, was this man. His face had
been deeply tanned and wrinkled by many a
sun. His hair was snow white. A wandering
philosopher and preacher, he had taken up his
abode in a natural cavern between great rocks.
He welcomed these frightened girls to a place
of security by his fireside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably nothing to frighten you,&rdquo; he reassured
them. &ldquo;There are many of us sleeping
out here among the rocks. In these times when
work is scarce, when millions know not when
or where they are to eat and when, like our
Master, many of us have nowhere to lay our
heads, it will not seem strange that so many,
some by the aid of a pile of broken bricks and
some with cast-off boards and sheet-iron,
should fashion here homes of a sort which they
may for a brief time call their own.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">[124]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he added quickly, &ldquo;all too soon
this will be a thing of the past. Buildings will
rise here and there. They are rising even now.
Three have been erected on these very shores.
Scores of buildings will dot them soon. Palm
trees will wave, orange trees blossom, grass
and flowers will fringe deep lagoons where
bright boats flash in the sun. All this will rise
as if by magic and our poor abodes built of
cast-off things will vanish, our camp fires
gleam no more.&rdquo; His voice trailed off into
nothingness. For a time after that they sat
there silent, staring at the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said Florence, speaking with some
effort, &ldquo;will be too bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I suppose not.&rdquo; The old man&rsquo;s voice
was mellow. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to be a Fair, a great
Exposition. Millions of eager feet will tramp
over the very spot where we now sit in such
silence and peace. They are to call it the &lsquo;Century
of Progress.&rsquo; Progress,&rdquo; he added dreamily.
&ldquo;Progress. That is life. There must be
progress. Time marches on. What matter
that some are left behind?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">[125]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But, see!&rdquo; His tone changed. &ldquo;Great clouds
are banking up in the west. There will be a
storm! My poor shelter does well enough for
me. For you it will not suffice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will do well to go forward,&rdquo; he advised,
as they sprang to their feet. &ldquo;It is a
long way back over the path you have come.
If you go forward it is only a matter of a few
blocks to a bridge over the railroad tracks.
And across that bridge you will find shelter
and a street car to carry you home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he stood there by the fire, watching
their departure, he seemed a heroic figure, this
wandering philosopher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; Florence whispered to herself, &ldquo;it
is not always the rich, the famous, the powerful
who most truly serve mankind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once more she was reminded of the little
old lady and her one treasure, the priceless
cameo fashioned by skilled and loving fingers
so many years ago.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">[126]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And I promised to return it to her!&rdquo;
This thought was one almost of despair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;I made that
promise out of pure love. Who knows how
Providence may assist me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There appeared to be, however, little time
for thoughts other than those of escape from
the storm. Their hurried march south began
at once.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>As for the man who had so inspired them
with terror, the one of the evil eye, he had not
followed them. There is some reason to doubt
that he so much as saw them. Had his attention
been directed toward them, it seems probable
that he would have passed them by as unknown
to him and quite unimportant for he,
as we must recall, knew Jeanne only as the
boy usher, Pierre.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">[127]</div>
<p>Truth was, this young man, who would have
laughed to scorn any suggestion that his home
might be found in this tumbled place, was engaged
in a special sort of business that apparently
required haste; for, after passing down
the winding path at a kind of trotting walk,
he hastened past a dark bulk that was a building
of some size, turned to the right, crossed
a temporary wooden bridge to come out at
last upon the island which was also a part of
the city&rsquo;s &ldquo;made land.&rdquo; It was upon this island
that Florence, a few evenings before, had discovered
the mysterious girl and the more
mystifying house that was so much like a ship,
and yet so resembled a tiny church.</p>
<p>Even while the two girls talked to the ragged
philosopher, this evil-eyed one with the
dark and forbidding face had crossed the
island and, coming out at the south end, had
mounted the rock-formed breakwater where
some frame-like affair stood.</p>
<p>At the far end of the frame was a dark circle
some twenty feet in diameter. This circle was
made of steel. It supported a circular dip-net
for catching fish. There was a windlass at the
end of the pole supporting the net. By unwinding
the windlass one might allow the net
to sink into the water. If luck were with him,
he might hope to draw it up after a time with
a fair catch of perch or herring.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">[128]</div>
<p>All day long this windlass might be heard
screaming and creaking as it lifted and lowered
the net. For the present it was silent.
The fisherman slept. Not so this dark prowler.</p>
<p>The man with the evil eye was not alone
upon the rocks that night, though beyond a
shadow of a doubt he believed himself to be.
Off to the left, at a distance of forty yards, a
dark figure, bent over in a position of repose
and as still as the rocks themselves, cast a dark
shadow over the near-by waters. Did this figure&rsquo;s
head turn? Who could say? Certainly
the man could not, for he believed himself
alone. However, he apparently did not expect
to remain unmolested long, for his eyes were
constantly turning toward the barren stretch
of sand he had crossed.</p>
<p>His movements betrayed a nervous fear, yet
he worked rapidly. Having searched about for
some time, he located a battered bucket. This
he filled with water. Bringing it up, he threw
the entire contents of the bucket upon the
windlass. Not satisfied with this, he returned
for a second bucket of water and repeated the
operation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">[129]</div>
<p>Satisfied at last, he drew a package wrapped
in black oilcloth from beneath his coat and
tossed it to the center of the dangling net.
Then with great care lest the rusty windlass,
for all the careful soaking he had given it,
should let out a screeching complaint, he quietly
lowered the net into the lake. The water
had done its work; the windlass gave forth no
sound.</p>
<p>After this he turned and walked slowly
away.</p>
<p>He was some fifty feet from the windlass,
busy apparently in contemplating the dark
clouds that threatened to obscure the moon,
when almost at the same instant two causes
for disturbance entered his not uneventful life.
From the direction of the lake came a faint
splash. At the brow of the little ridge over
which he had passed to reach this spot, two
men had appeared.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">[130]</div>
<p>That the men were not unexpected was at
once evident. He made no attempt to conceal
himself. That the splash puzzled him went
without question. He covered half the distance
to the breakwater, then paused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poof! Nothing! Wharf rat, perhaps,&rdquo; he
muttered, then returned to his contemplation
of the clouds. Yet, had he taken notice before
of that silent figure on the rocks, he might
now have discovered that it had vanished.</p>
<p>The two men advanced rapidly across the
stretch of sand. As they came close there was
about their movements an air of caution. At
last one spoke:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t try anything, Al. We got you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. And the goods are on you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dark, evil-eyed one who was apparently
known as Al, stood his ground.</p>
<p>The moon lost itself behind a cloud. The
place went dark. Yet when the moon reappeared,
bringing out the gleam of an officer&rsquo;s
star upon the breast of one of the newcomers,
he stood there motionless.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">[131]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Will you hand it over, or shall we take you
in?&rdquo; It was the man with the star who spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got nothing on me!&rdquo; Al threw open
his coat. &ldquo;Look me over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will. And then&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah? And then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that instant, all unseen, a dripping figure
emerged from the water close to the submerged
fishing net. It was the figure that, but
a short half hour before had rested motionless
upon the rocks; a slender girl whose figure
was for a second fully outlined by a distant
flash of lightning. She carried some dark object
beneath her right arm.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">[132]</div>
<h2 id="c14"><br />CHAPTER XIV
<br />THE DISAPPEARING PARCEL</h2>
<p>In the meantime Florence and Jeanne were
making the best of their opportunity to
leave the &ldquo;made land.&rdquo; They hoped to cross
the bridge and reach the car line before the
threatened storm broke. Petite Jeanne was
terribly afraid of lightning. Every time it
streaked across the sky she gripped her strong
companion&rsquo;s arm and shuddered.</p>
<p>It was impossible to make rapid progress.
From this point the beaten path disappeared.
There were only scattered tracks where other
pedestrians had picked their way through the
litter of debris.</p>
<p>Here Florence caught her foot in a tangled
mass of wire and all but fell to the ground;
there Jeanne stepped into a deep hole; and
here they found their way blocked by a heap
of fragments from a broken sidewalk.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">[133]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why did we come this way?&rdquo; Petite Jeanne
cried in consternation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The other was longer, more dangerous.
Cheer up! We&rsquo;ll make it.&rdquo; Florence took her
arm and together they felt their way forward
through the darkness that grew deeper and
blacker at every step.</p>
<p>Rolling up as they did at the back of a city&rsquo;s
skyscrapers, the mounting clouds were terrible
to see.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The throng!&rdquo; Petite Jeanne&rsquo;s heart fairly
stopped beating. &ldquo;What must a terrific thunderstorm
mean to that teaming mass of humanity?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even at her own moment of distress, this
unselfish child found time for a compassionate
thought for those hundreds of thousands
who still thronged the city streets.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">[134]</div>
<p>As for the crowds, not one person of them
all was conscious that a catastrophe impended.
Walled in on every side by skyscrapers, no
slightest glance to the least of those black
clouds was granted them. Their ears filled by
the honk of horns, the blare of bands and the
shouts of thousands, they heard not one rumble
of distant thunder. So they laughed and
shouted, crowded into this corner and that,
to come out shaken and frightened; but never
did one of them say, &ldquo;It will storm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yet out of this merry-mad throng two beings
were silent. A boy of sixteen and a
hunchback of uncertain age, hovering in a
doorway, looked, marveled a little, and appeared
to wait.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When will it break up?&rdquo; the boy asked out
of the corner of his mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Early,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s too many
of &rsquo;em. They can&rsquo;t have much fun. See!
They&rsquo;re flooding the grandstands. The bands
can&rsquo;t play. They&rsquo;ll be going soon. And
then&mdash;&rdquo; The hunchback gave vent to a low
chuckle.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>After snatching a pair of boy&rsquo;s strap-overalls
from the rocks the girl, who had emerged
from the water beside the submerged net, with
the dark package under her arm hurried away
over a narrow path and lost herself at once
in the tangled mass of willows and cottonwood.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">[135]</div>
<p>She had not gone far before a light appeared
at the end of that trail.</p>
<p>Seen from the blackness of night, the structure
she approached took on a grotesque aspect.
With two small round windows set well
above the door, it seemed the face of some
massive monster with a prodigious mouth and
great gleaming eyes. The girl, it would seem,
was not in the least frightened by the monster,
for she walked right up to its mouth and,
after wrapping her overalls about the black
package which still dripped lake water, opened
the door, which let out a flood of yellow light,
and disappeared within.</p>
<p>Had Florence witnessed all this, her mystification
regarding this child of the island
might have increased fourfold.</p>
<p>As you already know, Florence was not
there. She was still with Petite Jeanne on the
strip of &ldquo;made land&rdquo; that skirted the shore.
They were more than a mile from the island.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">[136]</div>
<p>They had come at last to a strange place.
Having completely lost their way in the darkness,
they found themselves of a sudden facing
a blank wall.</p>
<p>A strange wall it was, too. It could not be
a house for, though made of wood, this wall
was composed not of boards but of round posts
set so close together that a hand might not be
thrust between them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wh&mdash;where are we?&rdquo; Jeanne cried in
despair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; Florence had fortified her
mind against any emergency. &ldquo;I do know this
wall must have an end. We must find it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was right. The curious wall of newly
hewn posts did have an end. They were not
long in finding it. Coming to a corner they
turned it and again followed on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is some enclosure,&rdquo; Florence philosophized.
&ldquo;It may enclose some form of shelter.
And, from the looks of the sky, shelter is what
we will need very soon.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">[137]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes! Yes!&rdquo; cried her companion, as a flare
of lightning gave her an instant&rsquo;s view of their
surroundings. &ldquo;There is a building looming
just over there. The strangest sort of building,
but a shelter all the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ten minutes of creeping along that wall in
the dark, and they came to a massive gate.
This, too, was built of logs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a chain,&rdquo; Florence breathed as she
felt about. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s fastened, but not locked. Shall
we try to go in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes! Yes! Let us go in!&rdquo; A sharp flash of
lightning had set the little French girl&rsquo;s nerves
all a-quiver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on then.&rdquo; There was a suggestion
of mystery in Florence&rsquo;s tone. &ldquo;We will feel
our way back to that place you saw.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gate swung open a crack. They crept
inside. The door swung to. The chain rattled.
Then once more they moved forward in the
dark.</p>
<p>After a time, by the aid of a vivid flash, they
made out a tall, narrow structure just before
them. A sudden dash, and they were inside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&mdash;we&rsquo;re here,&rdquo; Florence panted, &ldquo;but
where are we?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">[138]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oo&mdash;o! How dark!&rdquo; Petite Jeanne pressed
close to her companion&rsquo;s side. &ldquo;I am sure there
are no windows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The windows are above,&rdquo; whispered Florence.
A flash of lightning had revealed an
opening far above her head.</p>
<p>At the same instant she stumbled against a
hard object.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a stairway,&rdquo; she announced after a
brief inspection. &ldquo;A curious sort of stairway,
too. The steps are shaped like triangles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That means it is a spiral stairway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And each step is thick and rough as if it
were hand-hewn with an axe. But who would
hew planks by hand in this day of steam and
great sawmills?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go up. We may be able to see something
from the windows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cautiously, on hands and knees, they made
their way up the narrow stairway. The platform
they reached and the window they looked
through a moment later were quite as mysterious
as the stairway. Everywhere was the
mark of an axe. The window was narrow, a
mere slit not over nine inches wide and quite
devoid of glass.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">[139]</div>
<p>Yet from this window they were to witness
one of God&rsquo;s greatest wonders, a storm at
night upon the water.</p>
<p>The dark clouds had swung northward.
They were now above the surface of the lake.
Blackness vied with blackness as clouds
loomed above the water. Like a great electric
needle sewing together two curtains of purple
velvet for a giant&rsquo;s wardrobe, lightning darted
from sky to sea and from sea to sky again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&mdash;how marvelous! How terrible!&rdquo;
Petite Jeanne pressed her companion&rsquo;s arm
hard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what a place of mystery!&rdquo; Florence
answered back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what place <i>is</i> this?&rdquo; Jeanne&rsquo;s voice was
filled with awe. &ldquo;And where are we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; Florence repeated, &ldquo;is a place of
mystery, and this is a night of adventure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Adventure and mystery,&rdquo; she thought to
herself, even as she said the words. Once more
she thought of the cameo.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">[140]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I promised to return it to-morrow. And
now it seems I am moving farther and farther
from it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Had she but known it, the time was not far
distant when, like two bits of flotsam on a
broad sea, she and the lost cameo would be
drifting closer and closer together. And,
strange as it may seem, the owner of the
cameo, that frail, little, old lady, was to play
an important part in the lives of Petite Jeanne
and Florence.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>In the meantime the two officers and the
man of the evil eye were playing a bit of drama
all their own on the sand-blown desert portion
of the island.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to come clean!&rdquo; the senior officer
was saying to the man whom he addressed
as Al.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All you got to do is search me. You&rsquo;ll find
nothing on me, not even a rod.&rdquo; The man
stood his ground.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">[141]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Fair enough.&rdquo; With a skill born of long
practice, the veteran detective went through
the man&rsquo;s clothes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve cach&eacute;d it,&rdquo; he grumbled, as he stood
back empty-handed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not in on the know.&rdquo; The suspicion
of a smile flitted across the dark one&rsquo;s face.
&ldquo;Whatever you&rsquo;re looking for, I never had it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No? We&rsquo;ll look about a bit, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The officers mounted the breakwater to go
flashing electric lanterns into every cavity. As
the boom of thunder grew louder they abandoned
the search to go tramping back across
the barren sand.</p>
<p>Left to himself, Al made a pretense of leaving
the island, but in reality lost himself from
sight on the very brush-grown trail the nymph
of the lake had taken a short time before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll be&mdash;!&rdquo; he muttered, as he brought
up squarely before the structure that seemed
a monster&rsquo;s head, whose eyes by this time were
quite sightless. The light had blinked off some
moments before.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">[142]</div>
<p>After walking around the place twice, he
stood before the door and lifted a hand as if
to knock. Appearing to think better of this,
he sank down upon the narrow doorstep, allowed
his head to fall forward, and appeared
to sleep.</p>
<p>Not for long, however. Foxes do not sleep
in the night. Having roused himself, he stole
back over the trail, crept to the breakwater,
lifted himself to a point of elevation, and surveyed
the entire scene throughout three lightning
flashes. Then, apparently satisfied, he
made his way to the windlass he had left an
hour or two before. He repeated the process
of drowning the complaining voice of the
windlass and then, turning the crank, rapidly
lifted the dripping net from the bottom of the
lake.</p>
<p>With fingers that trembled slightly, he drew
a small flashlight from his pocket to cast its
light across the surface of the net.</p>
<p>Muttering a curse beneath his breath, he
flashed the light once again, and then stood
there speechless.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">[143]</div>
<p>What had happened? The meshes of that
net were fine, so fine that a dozen minnows
not more than two inches long struggled vainly
at its center. Yet the package he had thrown
in this net was gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone!&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;It can&rsquo;t have floated.
Heavy. Heavy as a stone. And I had my eyes
on it, every minute; all but&mdash;but the time I
went down that trail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They tricked me!&rdquo; he growled. He was
thinking now of the policemen. &ldquo;But no! How
could they? I saw them go, saw them on the
bridge. Couldn&rsquo;t have come back. Not time
enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this he thrust both hands deep in his
pockets and went stumping away.</p>

<h2 id="c15"><br />CHAPTER XV
<br />STRANGE VOICES</h2>
<p>As for Florence and Jeanne, they were still
hidden away in that riddle of a place by
the lake shore on &ldquo;made land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A more perplexing place of refuge could not
have been found. What was it? Why was it
here? Were there men about the place within
the palisades? These were the questions that
disturbed even the stout-hearted Florence.</p>
<p>They were silent for a long time, those two.
When at last Jeanne spoke, Florence started
as if a stranger had addressed her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This place,&rdquo; said Petite Jeanne, &ldquo;reminds
me of a story I once read before I came to
America. In my native land we talked in
French, of course, and studied in French. But
we studied English just as you study French
in America.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">[145]</div>
<p>&ldquo;A story in my book told of early days in
America. It was thrilling, oh, very thrilling
indeed! There were Indians, real red men who
scalped their victims and held wild war dances.
There were scouts and soldiers. And there
were forts all built of logs hewn in the forest.
And in these forts there were&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fort,&rdquo; Florence broke in, &ldquo;a fort. Of course,
that is what this is, a fort for protection from
Indians.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Indians!&rdquo; Jeanne&rsquo;s tone reflected her
surprise. &ldquo;Real live, wild Indians! There are
none here now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not!&rdquo; Florence laughed a merry
laugh. &ldquo;This is not, after all, a real fort. It is
only a reproduction of a very old fort that was
destroyed many years ago, old Fort Dearborn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I do not understand. Why did they
put it here?&rdquo; Petite Jeanne was perplexed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is to be part of the great Fair, the Century
of Progress. It was built in order that
memories of those good old frontier days
might be brought back to us in the most vivid
fashion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">[146]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Just think of being here now, just we
alone!&rdquo; Florence enthused. &ldquo;Let us dream a
little. The darkness is all about us. On the
lake there is a storm. There is no city now;
only a village straggling along a stagnant
stream. Wild ducks have built their nests in
the swamps over yonder. And in the forest
there are wild deer. In the cabins by the river
women and children sleep. But we, you and
I, we are sentries for the night. Indians prowl
through the forest. The silent dip of their
paddles sends their canoes along the shallow
water close to shore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See! There is a flash of light. What is
that on the lake? Indian canoes? Or floating
logs?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall we arouse the garrison? No! No!
We will wait. It may be only logs after all.
And if Indians, they may be friendly, for this
is supposed to be a time of peace, though dark
rumors are afloat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence&rsquo;s voice trailed away. The low rumble
of thunder, the swish of water on a rocky
shore, and then silence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">[147]</div>
<p>Petite Jeanne shook herself. &ldquo;You make it
all so very real. Were those good days, better
days than we are knowing now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who can tell?&rdquo; Florence sighed. &ldquo;They
seem very good to us now. But we must not
forget that they were hard days, days of real
sickness and real death. We must not forget
that once the garrison of this fort marched
forth with the entire population, prepared to
make their way to a place of greater safety;
that they were attacked and massacred by the
treacherous red men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must not forget these things, nor
should we cease to be thankful for the courage
and devotion of those pioneers who dared to
enter a wilderness and make their homes here,
that we who follow after them might live in
a land of liberty and peace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Petite Jeanne&rsquo;s tone was solemn, &ldquo;we
will not forget.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">[148]</div>
<p>In the meantime the pleasure-seeking
throng, all unconscious of the storm that had
threatened to deluge them, still roamed the
streets. Their ranks, however, were thinning.
One by one the bands, which were unable to
play because of the press, and might not have
been heard because of the tumult, folded up
their music and their stands and instruments
and, like the Arabs, &ldquo;silently stole away.&rdquo; The
radio stars who could not be seen answered
other calls. Grandstands were deserted, street
cars and elevated trains were packed. The
great city had had one grand look at itself. It
was now going home.</p>
<p>And still, lurking in the doorway, the grown
boy in shabby clothes and the hunchback
lingered, waiting, expectant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t be long now,&rdquo; the hunchback
muttered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t be long,&rdquo; the other echoed.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>Petite Jeanne, though a trifle disappointed
by the dispelling of the mystery of their immediate
surroundings, soon enough found
herself charmed by Florence&rsquo;s vivid pictures
of life in those days when Chicago was a village,
when the Chicago River ran north instead
of south, and Indians still roamed the
prairies in search of buffaloes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">[149]</div>
<p>How this big, healthy, adventure-loving
girl would have loved the life they lived in
those half forgotten days! As it was, she could
live them now only in imagination. This she
did to her heart&rsquo;s content.</p>
<p>So they lingered long, these two. Seated on
a broad, hand-hewn bench, looking out over
the dark waters, waiting in uncertainty for
the possible return of the storm that, having
spent its fury in a vain attempt to drown the
lake, did not return, they lived for the most
part in the past, until a clock striking somewhere
in the distance announced the hour of
midnight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twelve!&rdquo; Petite Jeanne breathed in great
surprise. &ldquo;It will not rain now. We must go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Florence sprang to her feet. &ldquo;We
must go at once.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">[150]</div>
<p>The moon was out now; the storm had
passed. Quietly enough they started down
the winding stairs. Yet startling developments
awaited them just around the corner.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile on the city streets the
voice of the tumult had died to a murmur.
Here came the rumble of a passing train; from
this corner came the sound of hammers dismantling
grandstands that the morning rush
might not be impeded. Other than these there
was no sign that a great city had left its homes
and had for once taken one long interested
look at itself only to return to its homes again.</p>
<p>As Florence and Jeanne stepped from the
door of the blockhouse they were startled by
the sound of voices in low but animated conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, at this hour of the night!&rdquo; At once
Florence was on the defensive. The fort, she
knew, was not yet open to the public. Even
had it been, located as it was on this desolate
stretch of &ldquo;made land,&rdquo; it would be receiving
no visitors at midnight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come!&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;They are over
there, toward the gate. We dare not try to
go out, not yet.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">[151]</div>
<p>Seizing Jeanne by the hand, she led her
along the dark shadows of a wall and at last
entered a door.</p>
<p>The place was strange to them; yet to
Florence it had a certain familiarity. This
was a moment when her passion for the study
of history stood her in good stead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the officers&rsquo; quarters,&rdquo; she whispered.
&ldquo;There should be a door that may be
barred. The windows are narrow, the casements
heavy. Here one should be safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was not mistaken. Hardly had they entered
than she closed the door and let down a
massive wooden bar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; she breathed, &ldquo;we are safe, unless&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She broke short off. A thought had struck
her all of a heap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unless what?&rdquo; Jeanne asked breathlessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unless this place has a night watchman.
If it has, and he finds us here at this hour of
the night we will be arrested for trespassing.
And then we will have a ride in a police wagon
which won&rsquo;t be the least bit of fun.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">[152]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; agreed Jeanne in a solemn tone, &ldquo;it
won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that,&rdquo; whispered Florence, as she tiptoed
about examining things, &ldquo;seems to be
about what we are up against. I had thought
the place a mere unfurnished wooden shell.
That is the way the blockhouse was. But see!
At the end of this room is a fireplace, and beside
it are all sorts of curious cooking utensils,
great copper kettles, skillets of iron with yard-long
handles and a brass cornhopper. Coming
from the past, they must be priceless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And see! There above the mantel are flintlock
rifles,&rdquo; Jeanne put in. &ldquo;And beside the
fireplace are curious lanterns with candles in
them. How I wish we could light them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We dare not,&rdquo; said Florence. &ldquo;But one
thing we can do. We can sit in that dark corner
where the moon does not fall, and dream
of other days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And in the meantime?&rdquo; Jeanne barely suppressed
a shudder.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">[153]</div>
<p>&ldquo;In the meantime we will hope that the
guard, if there be one, goes out for his midnight
lunch and that we may slip out unobserved.
Truly we have right enough to do
that. We have meant no harm and have done
none.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, sitting there in the dark, dreaming, they
played that Florence was the youthful commander
of the fort and that the slender Jeanne
was his young bride but recently brought into
this wilderness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The wild life and the night frighten you,&rdquo;
Florence said to Jeanne. &ldquo;But I am young and
strong. I will protect you. Come! Let us sit
by the fire here and dream a while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jeanne laughed a low musical laugh and
snuggled closer.</p>
<p>But, for Jeanne, the charm of the past had
departed. Try as she might, she could not
overcome the fear that had taken possession
of her upon realizing that they were not alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who can these men be?&rdquo; she asked herself.
&ldquo;Guards? Perhaps, and perhaps not.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">[154]</div>
<p>She thought of the dark-faced man who so
inspired her with fear. &ldquo;We saw him out there
on the waste lands,&rdquo; she told herself, as a chill
coursed up her spine. &ldquo;It is more than probable
that he saw us. He may have followed
us, watching us like a cat. And now, at this
late hour, when a piercing scream could
scarcely be heard, like a cat he may be ready
to spring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a great state of agitation she rose and
crept noiselessly toward the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;See yonder! Two
men are slinking along before that other log
building. One is stooped like a hunchback.
He is carrying a well-filled sack upon his back.
Surely they cannot be guards.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can it be that this place is left unguarded,
and that it is being robbed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here was a situation indeed. Two girls in
this lonely spot, unguarded and with such
prowlers about.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad the door is b-barred.&rdquo; Jeanne&rsquo;s
teeth chattered.</p>
<p>Having gone skulking along the building
across the way, the men entered and closed the
door. Two or three minutes later a wavering
light appeared at one of the narrow windows.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">[155]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps they are robbing that place of
some precious heirlooms!&rdquo; Florence&rsquo;s heart
beat painfully, but she held herself in splendid
control.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This buil-building will be next!&rdquo; Jeanne
spoke with difficulty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps. I&mdash;I think we should do something
about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall know. Providence will guide us.&rdquo;
Florence&rsquo;s hand was on the bar. It lifted
slowly.</p>
<p>What was to happen? They were going outside,
Jeanne was sure of that. But what was
to happen after that? She could not tell. Getting
a good grip on herself, she whispered
bravely:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You lead. I&rsquo;ll follow.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">[156]</div>
<h2 id="c16"><br />CHAPTER XVI
<br />THROUGH THE WINDOW</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Come!&rdquo; Florence whispered, as the door
of the ancient barracks swung open
and they tiptoed out into the night. &ldquo;We must
find out what those men are doing. This place
was built in memory of the past for the good
of the public. Generous-hearted people have
loaned the rare treasures that are stored here.
They must not be lost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Skirting the buildings, gliding along the
shadows, they made their way past the powder-magazine
all built of stone, moved onward
the length of a log building that loomed in
the dark, dashed across a corner and arrived
at last with wildly beating hearts at the corner
of the building from which the feeble, flickering
light still shone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">[157]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now!&rdquo; Florence breathed, gripping her
breast in a vain attempt to still the wild beating
of her heart. &ldquo;Not a sound! We must
reach that window.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leading the way, she moved in breathless
silence, a foot at a time along the dark wall.
Now she was twenty feet from the window,
now ten, now&mdash;. She paused with a quick intake
of breath. Did she hear footsteps? Were
they coming out? And if they did?</p>
<p>Flattening herself against the wall, she drew
Jeanne close to her. A moment passed. Her
watch ticked loudly. From some spot far away
a hound baying the moon gave forth a long-drawn
wail.</p>
<p>Two minutes passed, three, four.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&mdash;they&rsquo;re not coming out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taking the trembling hand of the little
French girl in her own, she once more led her
forward.</p>
<p>And now they were at the window, peering
in with startled eyes.</p>
<p>What they saw astonished them beyond belief.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">[158]</div>
<p>Crouching on the floor, lighted only by a
flashlight lantern, was a grown boy and a
hunchbacked man. The boy at that moment
was in the act of dumping the contents of a
large bag upon the log floor of the building.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Loot!&rdquo; whispered Florence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why do they pour it out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence placed two fingers on her companion&rsquo;s
lips.</p>
<p>That the articles had not been taken from
the fort they realized at once, for the boy, holding
up a modern lady&rsquo;s shoe with an absurdly
high heel, gave forth a hoarse laugh.</p>
<p>There were other articles, all modern; a
spectacle-case with broken lenses inside but
gold rims still good, another pair of glasses
with horn rims that had not been broken; and
there were more shoes.</p>
<p>And, most interesting of all, there were several
purses. That the strange pair regarded
these purses with the greatest interest was
manifested by the manner in which they had
their heads together as the first was opened.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">[159]</div>
<p>Shaking the contents into his huge fist, the
hunchback picked out some small coins and
handed them to the boy. A glittering compact
and a folded bill he thrust into the side pocket
of his coat. The boy frowned, but said not a
word. Instead he seized upon a second pocket-book
and prepared to inspect it for himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pickpockets!&rdquo; Jeanne whispered. &ldquo;They
have been working on that helpless throng.
Now they have come here to divide their loot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence did not answer.</p>
<p>The crouching boy was about to open the
second purse, the hunchback making no protest,
when to the girls there came cause for
fresh anxiety. From the far side of the enclosure
there came the rattle of chains.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Someone else,&rdquo; Florence whispered, &ldquo;and
at this hour of the night. But they cannot
harm us,&rdquo; came as an after-thought. &ldquo;The
chain is fastened on the inside.&rdquo; She was
thankful for this, but not for long.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how did these get in?&rdquo; Petite Jeanne
pointed to the crouching pair within.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get out!&rdquo; Jeanne pleaded. &ldquo;This is
work for an officer. We can send one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Someone is at the gate,&rdquo; Florence reminded
her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">[160]</div>
<p>Then there happened that which for the moment
held them glued to the spot. Having
thrust a hand into the second purse, a small
one, well worn, the crouching boy drew forth
an object that plainly puzzled him. He held it
close to the light. As he did so, Florence gave
vent to an involuntary gasp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cameo! The lost cameo!&rdquo; she exclaimed
half aloud. &ldquo;It must belong to our
little old lady of the merry-mad throng.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the same instant there came from behind
her a man&rsquo;s gruff voice in angry words:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, you! What you doing? Why do you
lock the gate? Thought you&rsquo;d keep me out,
eh?</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I fooled you!&rdquo; the voice continued. &ldquo;I
scaled the palisades.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Instantly there came sounds of movement
from within. The crouching figures were hastily
stuffing all that pile back into the sack and
at the same time eagerly looking for an avenue
of escape.</p>
<p>Florence caught the gleam of a star on the
newcomer&rsquo;s coat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">[161]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, please!&rdquo; she pleaded. &ldquo;We have taken
nothing, meant no harm. The storm&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But please, officer,&rdquo; her tone changed,
&ldquo;that pair within have been doing something,
perhaps robbing. They have a precious cameo
that belongs to a dear old lady. Please don&rsquo;t
let them escape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In answer to this breathless appeal the officer
made no reply. Instead he strode to the
window, looked within, then rapped smartly
on the sash with his club. At the same time
he pointed to his star.</p>
<p>The strange intruders could not fail to understand.
They shouldered their sack and
came forth meekly enough.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You come with me, all of you!&rdquo; the officer
commanded. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get this thing straight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now then,&rdquo; he commanded, after they had
crossed the enclosure in silence and he had
lighted a large lamp in a small office-like room,
&ldquo;dump that stuff on the floor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to tell ye,&rdquo; the hunchback grumbled,
&ldquo;that we hain&rsquo;t no thieves, me an&rsquo; this
boy. We hain&rsquo;t. We&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">[162]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Dump it out!&rdquo; The officer&rsquo;s tone was stern.</p>
<p>The hunchback obeyed. &ldquo;We found this, we
did; found all of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye-s, you found it!&rdquo; The officer bent over
to take up a purse. He opened it and emptied
a handful of coins on the table at his side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Purses!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;How many?&rdquo; He
counted silently. &ldquo;Seven of &rsquo;em and all full
of change. And you found &rsquo;em! Tell that to
the judge!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Honest, we found them.&rdquo; The grown boy
dragged a ragged sleeve across his eyes. &ldquo;We
was down to the Jubilee. People was always
crushin&rsquo; together and losin&rsquo; things in the
scramble, shoes and purses an&rsquo; all this.&rdquo; He
swept an arm toward the pile. &ldquo;So we just
stayed around until they was gone. Then we
got &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you thought because you found &rsquo;em
they were yours?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, ain&rsquo;t they?&rdquo; The hunchback grew
defiant.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">[163]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not by a whole lot!&rdquo; The officer&rsquo;s voice
was a trifle less stern. &ldquo;If you find a purse or
any other thing on the street, if it&rsquo;s worth the
trouble, you&rsquo;re supposed to turn it in, and you
leave your name. If it&rsquo;s not called for, you get
it back. But you can&rsquo;t gather things up in a
sack and just walk off. That don&rsquo;t go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See here!&rdquo; He held up a tiny leather frame
taken from the purse he had emptied. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
a picture of an old lady with white hair; somebody&rsquo;s
mother, like as not. What&rsquo;s it worth to
you? Not that!&rdquo; He snapped his fingers. &ldquo;But
to the real owner it&rsquo;s a precious possession.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; Florence broke in eagerly, &ldquo;and
there&rsquo;s a ragged little purse in that pile that
contains a dear old lady&rsquo;s only real possession,
a cameo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;d you know that?&rdquo; The officer turned
sharply upon her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We saw it in his hand.&rdquo; She held her
ground, nodding at the boy. &ldquo;We were with
the lady, helping her out of the crush, when
she lost it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;you look like that kind,&rdquo; the officer
said slowly, studying her face. &ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;m going
to take a chance. Got her address?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">[164]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give it to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here. Write it down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good. Now then, you pick out the purse
and show me this thing you call a cameo.
Never heard of one before, but if it&rsquo;s different
from everything else I&rsquo;ve seen it must be one
of them cameos.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh tha-thank you!&rdquo; Florence choked. She
had made a promise to the little old lady.
Now the promise was near to fulfillment.</p>
<p>The purse was quickly found and the cameo
exposed to view.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a cameo all right,&rdquo; the officer
grinned. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing else I ever saw. You
take it to her and may God bless you for your
interest in an old lady.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence found her eyes suddenly dimmed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As for you!&rdquo; The officer&rsquo;s tone grew stern
once more as he turned to the marauding pair.
&ldquo;You give me your names and tell me where
you live. I&rsquo;ll just keep all this stuff as it is, and
turn it in. If any of it remains unclaimed we&rsquo;ll
let you know.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">[165]</div>
<p>Glad to know that they were not to be sent
to jail for a misdemeanor they had committed
in ignorance, the strange pair gave their names
and place of residence and then disappeared
into the shadows whence they had come.</p>
<p>The officer, whose duty it was to keep an eye
on lake shore property, escorted the girls to
the street car line, then bade them good-night.</p>
<p>There were times when the little French girl
could not sleep. On returning to her room,
she found that, despite the lateness of the hour,
her nerves were all a-tingle, her eyes wide and
staring.</p>
<p>Long after Florence had retired for the
night, she lay rolled in a soft, woolly blanket,
huddled up in a great chair before the fire.</p>
<p>At first, as she stared at the fire she saw
there only a confusion of blurred impressions.
In time these impressions took form and she
saw much of her own life spread out before
her. The opera, its stage resplendent with
color, light and life; the boxes shrouded in
darkness; these she saw. The great estate,
home of Rosemary Robinson, was there, and
the glowing magic curtain that appeared to
burn but was not consumed; these were there
too.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">[166]</div>
<p>As in a dream she heard voices: The lady
in black spoke, Jaeger, the detective, and
Rosemary. She seemed to catch the low murmur
of the hunchback and that boy of his;
heard, too, the sharp call of the man with the
evil eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All this,&rdquo; she said aloud, &ldquo;fits in somehow.
&lsquo;There is a destiny that shapes our ends, rough
hew them how we may.&rsquo; If I could see it all
as it is to be when all is finished they would
all have their places, their work to do, the little
old lady, the crushing throng, the hooters, yes,
even the one with the dark face and evil eye:
all these may serve me in the end.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Serve me. Poor little me!&rdquo; She laughed
aloud, and, blazing with a merry crackle, the
fire appeared to laugh back.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">[167]</div>

<br />STARTLING REVELATIONS</h2>
<p>The circular fishing net, which had for so
unusual a purpose been lowered into the
lake at the dead of night and brought up later,
quite empty, belonged to a youth, known
among his acquaintances as &ldquo;Snowball.&rdquo;
Snowball was black, very black indeed.</p>
<p>When Snowball arrived at his net next
morning he found a white man sitting by his
windlass. This young man&rsquo;s eye had a glint
of blue steel in it that set the black boy&rsquo;s knees
quivering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That your net?&rdquo; The stranger nodded toward
the lake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yaas, sir!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Deep down there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tol&rsquo;able deep. Yaas, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Swim?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who? Me? Yaas, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">[168]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Here.&rdquo; The man slipped a bill between two
boards and left it fluttering there. &ldquo;Skin off
and dive down there. Black package down
there. See? Bring it up. See?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yaas, sir. Oh, yas, yas, sir.&rdquo; There surely
was something strange about the glint of
those eyes.</p>
<p>Snowball struggled out of his few bits of
loose clothing and, clad only in trunks, disappeared
beneath the surface of the lake.</p>
<p>A moment later he came to the surface.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got it?&rdquo; Those eyes again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;N&mdash;no, sir.&rdquo; The black boy&rsquo;s teeth chattered.
&ldquo;Nothin&rsquo; down there. Not nothin&rsquo; at
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go down again. You got poor eyes!&rdquo; The
man made a move. Snowball disappeared.</p>
<p>He came up again sputtering. &ldquo;Hain&rsquo;t
nothin&rsquo;. Tellin&rsquo; y&rsquo; th&rsquo; truth, sir. Just nothin&rsquo;
at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The stranger made a threatening move.
Snowball was about to disappear once more,
when a shrill laugh came rippling across the
rocks.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">[169]</div>
<p>The man turned, startled, then frowned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s pleasing you, sister?&rdquo; He addressed
this remark to a slim girl in a faded bathing
suit, seated on a rock a hundred feet away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Snowball&rsquo;s right.&rdquo; The girl laughed again.
&ldquo;Nothing down there. Nothing at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man gave her a quick look, then sprang
to his feet. The next instant he was scrambling
over the rocks.</p>
<p>When he arrived at the spot where the girl
had been, she was nowhere to be seen. It was
as if the lake had swallowed her up; which,
perhaps it had.</p>
<p>Apparently the man believed it had, for he
sat down upon the rocks to wait. Ten minutes
passed. Not a ripple disturbed the surface.</p>
<p>He looked toward the windlass and the net.
Snowball, too, had vanished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crooks!&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;All crooks out
here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that, after picking his way across the
breakwater, he took to the stretches of sand
and soon disappeared.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_170">[170]</div>
<p>When, later that same day, Petite Jeanne
started away, bent on the joyous business of
returning a lost cameo to a dear old lady, she
expected to come upon no fresh mystery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; she said to Florence, who, because
of her work, could not accompany her,
&ldquo;in the bright light of day one experiences no
thrills.&rdquo; Surprise came to her all the same.</p>
<p>She had reached the very street crossing at
which she was to alight before she realized
that the address the little old lady had given
was in Chinatown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surprise number one,&rdquo; she murmured.
&ldquo;A white lady living in Chinatown. I can&rsquo;t
be wrong, for just over there is the temple
where I saw the magic curtain.&rdquo; If other evidence
were lacking, she had only to glance at
the pedestrians on the street. Nine out of every
ten were Chinese.</p>
<p>For a moment she stood quite still upon the
curb. Perhaps her experience on that other
occasion had inspired an unwarranted fear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For shame!&rdquo; She stamped her small foot.
&ldquo;This is broad day! Why be afraid?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">[171]</div>
<p>Surprise number two came to her upon arriving
at the gate of the place she sought.
No dingy tenement this. The cutest little
house, set at the back of a tiny square of green
grass, flanked a curious rock garden where
water sparkled. The whole affair seemed to
have been lifted quite complete from some
Chinese fairy book.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the wrong address.&rdquo; Her spirits
drooped a little.</p>
<p>But no. One bang at the gong that hung
just outside the door, and the little old lady
herself was peeping through a narrow crack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! It is you!&rdquo; she exclaimed, throwing
the door wide. &ldquo;And you have my cameo!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Jeanne smiled, &ldquo;I have your cameo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Because she was French, Jeanne was not at
all disturbed by the smothering caress she received
from the old lady of this most curious
house.</p>
<p>The next moment she was inside the house
and sinking deep in a great heap of silky,
downy pillows.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">[172]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But, my friend,&rdquo; she exclaimed, as soon as
she had caught her breath after a glance about
the room where only Oriental objects, dragons,
curious lanterns, silk banners, and thick mats
were to be found, &ldquo;this is Chinatown, and you
are not Oriental!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, my child. I am not.&rdquo; The little lady&rsquo;s
eyes sparkled. &ldquo;But for many years my father
was Consul to China. I lived with him and
came to know the Chinese people. I learned
to love them for their gentleness, their simplicity,
their kindness. They loved me too a
little, I guess, for after my father died and I
came to America, some rich Chinese merchants
prepared this little house for me. And here
I live.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; she sighed contentedly, &ldquo;I do
some translating for them and other little
things, but I do not have a worry. They provide
for me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this!&rdquo; She pressed the cameo to her
lips. &ldquo;This comes from another time, the long
lost, beautiful past when I was a child with my
father in Venice. That is why I prize it so.
Can you blame me?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">[173]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No! No!&rdquo; The little French girl&rsquo;s tone
was deeply earnest. &ldquo;I cannot. I, too, have
lived long in Europe. France, my own beautiful
France, was my childhood home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But tell me!&rdquo; Her tone took on an excited
note. &ldquo;If you know so much of these mysterious
Chinese, you can help me. Will you help
me? Will you explain something?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I can, my child. Gladly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A few days ago,&rdquo; the little French girl
leaned forward eagerly, &ldquo;I saw the most astonishing
curtain. It burned, but was not consumed,
like the burning bush.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You saw that?&rdquo; It seemed that the little
lady&rsquo;s eyes would pop from her head. &ldquo;You
saw that? Where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Over yonder.&rdquo; Jeanne waved a hand. &ldquo;In
that Chinese temple.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;did not&mdash;know it&mdash;was&mdash;here.&rdquo; The
little lady spoke very slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you have seen it!&rdquo; In her eagerness
Jeanne gripped the arms of her chair hard.
&ldquo;Tell me! What is it? How is it done? Could
one borrow it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">[174]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Borrow it? My child, you do not know
what you are asking!</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you&mdash;&rdquo; She lowered her voice to a
shrill whisper. &ldquo;How can you have seen it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quite excitedly and with many a gesture,
the little French girl told of her visit to the
Chinese temple on that rainy afternoon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my child!&rdquo; The little lady was all but
in tears as she finished, tears of excitement and
joy. &ldquo;My dear child! You cannot know what
you have done, nor how fortunate you are that
you escaped unharmed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this is America, not China!&rdquo; Jeanne&rsquo;s
tone showed her amazement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;True, my child. But every great American
city is many cities in one. On the streets you
are safe. When you pry into the secrets of
other people, that is quite another matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Secrets!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Chinese people seem to be simple,
kindly, harmless folks. So they are, on the
street. But in their private dealings they are
the most secretive people in the world.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">[175]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That temple you visited!&rdquo; It was her turn
to lean far forward. &ldquo;That is more than a
temple. It is a place of business, a chamber of
commerce and the meeting place of the most
powerful secret society the Chinese people
have ever known, the Hop Sing Tong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that meeting, the magic curtain&mdash;&rdquo;
Jeanne&rsquo;s eyes went wide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was beyond doubt a secret meeting
of the Tong. You came uninvited. Because
of the darkness you escaped. You may thank
Providence for that! But never, never do that
again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; Jeanne&rsquo;s tone was full of regret,
&ldquo;then I may never see the magic curtain
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, I wouldn&rsquo;t say that.&rdquo; The little lady
smiled blandly. &ldquo;Seeing the magic curtain and
attending the meeting of a secret society are
two different matters. The Chinese people
are very kind to me. Some of the richest
Chinese merchants&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Do you think you could arrange it?
Do you think I might see it, two or three
friends and I?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">[176]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It might be arranged.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you try?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will do my best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if it can be, will you let me know?&rdquo;
Jeanne rose to go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will let you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Jeanne left the room, she found herself
walking in a daze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And to think!&rdquo; she whispered to herself,
&ldquo;that this little old lady and her lost cameo
should so soon begin to fit into the marvelous
pattern of my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had wonderful dreams, had this little
French girl. She would see the magic curtain
once more. With her on this occasion should
be Marjory Dean, the great opera star, and
her friend Angelo who wrote operas. When
the magic curtain had been seen, an opera
should be written around it, an Oriental opera
full of mystery; a very short opera to be sure
but an opera all the same.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And perhaps!&rdquo; Her feet sped away in a
wild fling. &ldquo;Perhaps I shall have a tiny part
in that opera; a very tiny part indeed.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">[177]</div>
<h2 id="c18"><br />CHAPTER XVIII
<br />THEY THAT PASS IN THE NIGHT</h2>
<p>The opera presented that night was Wagner&rsquo;s
<i>Die Valkyre</i>. To Petite Jeanne, the
blithesome child of sunshine and song, it
seemed a trifle heavy. For all this she was fascinated
by the picture of life as it might have
been lived long before man began writing his
own history. And never before had she listened
to such singing.</p>
<p>It was in the last great scene that a fresh
hope for the future was borne in upon her.
In the opera, Brunhilde having, contrary to
the wishes of the gods, interceded for her lover
Sigmund, she must be punished. She pleads
her own cause in vain. At last she asks for a
special punishment: that she be allowed to
sleep encircled by fire until a hero of her people
is found strong enough to rescue her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">[178]</div>
<p>Her wish is granted. Gently the god raises
her and kisses her brow. Slowly she sinks upon
the rock while tongues of flame leap from the
rocks. Moment by moment the flames leap
higher until the heroine is lost from sight.</p>
<p>It was at the very moment when the fires
burned fiercest, the orchestra played its most
amazing strains, that a great thought came to
Jeanne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will do it!&rdquo; she cried aloud. &ldquo;How wonderful
that will be! We shall have an opera.
The magic curtain; it shall be like this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, realizing that there were people close
at hand, she clapped a hand to her lips and
was silent.</p>
<p>A moment more and the strains of delectable
music died away. Then it was that a man
touched Jeanne&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are French.&rdquo; The man had an unmistakable
accent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, monsieur.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would like a word with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes. If you will please wait here.&rdquo;
As Pierre, in a dress suit, Jeanne still had
work to do.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">[179]</div>
<p>Her head awhirl with her bright new idea,
her eyes still seeing red from the fires that
guarded Brunhilde, she hurried through with
her humble tasks. Little wonder that she had
forgotten the little Frenchman with the small
beard. She started when he touched her arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pardon, my son. May I now have a word
with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She started at that word &ldquo;son,&rdquo; but quickly
regained her poise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely you may.&rdquo; She was at his command.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am looking,&rdquo; he began at once, &ldquo;for a
little French girl named Petite Jeanne.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pet&mdash;Petite!&rdquo; The little French girl did
not finish. She was trembling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! Perhaps you know her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no. Ah, yes, yes,&rdquo; Jeanne answered in
wild confusion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will perhaps tell me where she lives.
I have a very important message for her. I
came from France to bring it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From France?&rdquo; Jeanne was half smothered
with excitement. What should she do? Should
she say: &ldquo;I am Petite Jeanne?&rdquo; Ah, no; she
dared not. Then an inspiration came to her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">[180]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You wish this person&rsquo;s address? This
Petite Jeanne?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you will,&rdquo; the man replied politely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well. I will write it down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Drawing a small silver pencil from her
pocket with trembling fingers, she wrote an
address upon the back of a program.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, monsieur. This is it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think&mdash;&rdquo; She shifted her feet uneasily.
&ldquo;I am sure she works rather late. If you were
to call, perhaps in an hour, you might find her
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So late as this?&rdquo; The Frenchman raised
his eyebrows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure she would not mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well. I shall try. And a thousand
thanks.&rdquo; He pressed a coin in her unwilling
hand. The next moment he had vanished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone!&rdquo; she murmured, sinking into a seat.
&ldquo;Gone! And he had an important message for
me! Oh! I must hurry home!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">[181]</div>
<p>Even as she spoke these words she detected
a rustle at the back of the box. Having turned
quickly about, she was just in time to see
someone pass into the narrow aisle. It was
the lady in black.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if she heard?&rdquo; Jeanne&rsquo;s heart
sank.</p>
<p>As she left the Opera House the little
French girl&rsquo;s spirits were low.</p>
<p>The lady in black frightened her. &ldquo;What can
she mean, always dogging my footsteps?&rdquo; she
asked herself as she sought the street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that dark-faced one? I saw him again
to-night by the door. Who is he? What can
he want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a little group of people gathered
by the door. As she passed out, she fancied
she caught a glimpse of that dark, forbidding
face, those evil eyes.</p>
<p>With a shudder she sped away. She was not
pursued.</p>
<p>At her apartment she quickly changed into
her own plain house dress. Having lighted the
living-room fire, she waited a little for the return
of Florence, who should have been home
long before.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">[182]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What can be keeping her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>With nervous, uncertain steps, she crossed
to her own chamber door. Having entered,
she went to the window. Her room was dark.
The street below was half dark. A distant
lamp cast a dim, swaying light. At first no
one was to be seen. Then a single dark figure
moved stealthily up the street. The swaying
light caused this person to take on the appearance
of an acrobat who leaped into the air,
then came down like a rubber ball. Even when
he paused to look up at the building before
him, he seemed to sway like a drunken sailor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That may be the man.&rdquo; Her pulse quickened.</p>
<p>A moment more and a car, careering down
the street, lighted the man&rsquo;s face. It did more.
It brought into the open for a second another
figure, deeper in the shadows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a strange pair!&rdquo; she murmured as
she shrank back.</p>
<p>The man least concealed was the dark-faced
one with the evil eye. The other man was
Jaeger, the detective.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">[183]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But they are not together,&rdquo; she assured herself.
&ldquo;Jaeger is watching the other, and the
dark one is watching me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even as she said this, a third person came
into view.</p>
<p>Instantly, by his slow stride, his military
bearing, she recognized the man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is he!&rdquo; She was thrown into a state of
tumult. &ldquo;It is my Frenchman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But what was this? He was on the opposite
side of the street, yet he did not cross over,
nor so much as glance that way. He marched
straight on.</p>
<p>She wanted to rush down the stairs and call
to him; yet she dared not, for were not those
sinister figures lurking there?</p>
<p>To make matters worse, the dark-faced one
took to following the Frenchman. Darting
from shadow to shadow, he obviously believed
himself unobserved. False security. Jaeger
was on his trail.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">[184]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What does it all mean?&rdquo; Jeanne asked herself.
&ldquo;Is this little Frenchman after all but
a tool of the police? Does he hope to trap me
and secure the pearls&mdash;which I do not have?
Or is he with that evil one with the desperate
eyes? Or is it true that he came but now from
France and bears a message for me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Since she could answer none of these questions,
she left her room, looked to the fastening
of the outer door, then took a seat by the
fire. There for a long time she tried to read
her fortune in the flames, but succeeded in seeing
only a flaming curtain that was not consumed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">[185]</div>
<h2 id="c19"><br />CHAPTER XIX
<br />THE UNSEEN EYE</h2>
<p>Five days passed. Uneventful days they
were for Petite Jeanne; yet each one was
charged with possibilities both wonderful and
terrible. She saw no more of Marjory Dean.
What of her promise? Had she forgotten?</p>
<p>The little old lady of the cameo she visited
once. The Chinese gentleman who might secure
for her one more shuddering look at the
magic curtain was out of town.</p>
<p>Never did she enter the opera at night without
casting fearful glances about lest she encounter
the dark-faced man of the evil eye.
He was never there. Where was he? Who was
he? What interest could he have in a mere
boy usher of the opera? To these questions
the little French girl could form no answer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">[186]</div>
<p>There were times when she believed him a
gypsy, or at least a descendant of gypsies from
France. When she thought of this she shuddered
anew. For in France were many enemies
of Bihari&rsquo;s band. And she was one of that
band.</p>
<p>At other times she was able to convince herself
that she had seen this dark-faced one at
the back of the boxes on that night when the
priceless pearls had vanished. Yet how this
could be when Jaeger, the detective, and the
mysterious lady in black haunted those same
shadows, she could not imagine.</p>
<p>Of late Jaeger was not always there. Perhaps
he was engaged in other affairs. It might
be that on that very night Jeanne had seen him
follow the dark-faced one, he had made an important
arrest. If so, whom had he apprehended,
the dark-faced one or the little
Frenchman with a military bearing?</p>
<p>Jeanne could not but believe that the little
man from France was honest and sincere, that
he truly bore an important message for her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why then did he not come that night
and deliver it?&rdquo; she said to Florence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps he lost his way.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">[187]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Lost his way? How could he? He was
here, just across the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You say two men followed him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he may have been frightened off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If so, why did he not return?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who can say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ah, yes, who could? Certainly no one, for
no one knew the full truth, which was that in
her excitement Jeanne had mixed her numbers
and, instead of presenting him with her own
address, had sent him five blocks down the
street where, as one must know, he found no
little French girl named Petite Jeanne. So
here is one matter settled, straight off. But
what of the business-like little Frenchman?
Did he truly bear a message of importance?
If so, what was the message? And where was
the man now? Not so easy to answer, these
questions.</p>
<p>Jeanne asked herself these questions and
many more during these days when, as Pierre,
she served the occupants of the boxes faithfully,
at the same time drinking in all the glory
and splendor of music, color and drama that is
Grand Opera at its best.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">[188]</div>
<p>A glimpse now and then of the lady in black
lurking in deep shadows never failed to thrill
her. Never did she see her face. Not once did
there come to her a single intimation of the
position she filled at the opera. As she felt that
unseen eye upon her, Jeanne experienced a
strange sensation. She went hot and cold all
over. Then a great calm possessed her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the strangest thing!&rdquo; she exclaimed to
Florence one night. &ldquo;It is like&mdash;what would
you call it?&mdash;a benediction. I am dreadfully
afraid; yet I find peace. It is like, shall I say,
like seeing God? Should you be afraid of God
if you saw Him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I think I might,&rdquo; Florence answered
soberly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet they say God is Love. Why should one
fear Love?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who knows? Anyway, your friend is not
God. She is only a lady in black. Perhaps she
is not Love either. Her true name may be
Hate.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">[189]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes, perhaps. But I feel it is not so.
And many times, oh my friend, when I <i>feel</i>
a thing is so it <i>is</i> so. But when I just think it
is true, then it is not true at all. Is this not
strange?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is strange. But you gypsies are strange
anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes, perhaps. For all that, I am not all
gypsy. Once I was not gypsy at all, only a
little French girl living in a little chateau by
the side of the road.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Petite Jeanne,&rdquo; Florence spoke with sudden
earnestness, &ldquo;have you no people living
in France?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father is dead, this I know.&rdquo; The little
French girl&rsquo;s head drooped. &ldquo;My mother also.
I have no brothers nor sisters save those who
adopted me long ago in a gypsy van. Who
else can matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncles and aunts, cousins, grandparents?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">[190]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes.&rdquo; The little French girl&rsquo;s brow
clouded. &ldquo;Now I remember. There was one&mdash;we
called her grandmother. Was she? I wonder.
We play that so many things are true, we
little ones. I was to see her twice. She was,
oh, so grand!&rdquo; She clasped her hands as if
in a dream. &ldquo;Lived at the edge of a wood, she
did, a great black forest, in a castle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A very beautiful castle it was to look at on
a sunny day, from the outside. Little towers
and spires, many little windows, all round and
square.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But inside?&rdquo; She made a face and shuddered.
&ldquo;Oh, so very damp and cold! No fires
here. No lights there. Only a bit of a brazier
that burned charcoal, very bright and not
warm at all. A grandmother? A castle? Ah,
yes, perhaps. But who wants so grand a castle
that is cold? Who would wish for a grandmother
who did not bend nor smile?</p>
<p>&ldquo;And besides,&rdquo; she added, as she sank into
a chair, &ldquo;she may not have been my grandmother
at all. This was long ago. I was only
a little one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the same,&rdquo; Florence muttered to herself,
some time later, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to know if that
was her grandmother. It might make a difference,
a very great difference.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">[191]</div>
<h2 id="c20"><br />CHAPTER XX
<br />A PLACE OF ENCHANTMENT</h2>
<p>Then came for Petite Jeanne an hour of
swiftly passing glory.</p>
<p>She had arisen late, as was her custom, and
was sipping her black coffee when the telephone
rang.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is Marjory Dean.&rdquo; The words came
to her over the wire in the faintest whisper.
But how they thrilled her! &ldquo;Is this Petite
Jeanne? Or is it Pierre?&rdquo; The prima donna
was laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is Petite Jeanne at breakfast,&rdquo; Jeanne
answered. Her heart was in her throat. What
was she to expect?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then will you please ask Pierre if it will
be possible for him to meet me at the Opera
House stage door at three this afternoon?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">[192]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I shall ask him.&rdquo; Jeanne put on a business-like
tone. For all that, her heart was pounding
madly. &ldquo;It may be my great opportunity!&rdquo;
she told herself. &ldquo;I may yet appear for a brief
space of time in an opera. What glory!&rdquo;</p>
<p>After allowing a space of thirty seconds to
elapse, during which time she might be supposed
to have consulted the mythical Pierre,
she replied quite simply:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Miss Dean, Pierre will meet you at
that hour. And he wishes me to thank you
very much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sh! Never a word of this!&rdquo; came over the
phone; then the voice was gone.</p>
<p>Jeanne spent the remainder of the forenoon
in a tumult of excitement. At noon she ate a
light lunch, drank black tea, then sat down to
study the score of her favorite opera, &ldquo;The
Juggler of Notre Dame.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is little wonder that Jeanne loved this
more than any other opera. It is the story of
a simple wanderer, a juggler. Jeanne, as we
have said before, had been a wanderer in
France. She had danced the gypsy dances
with her bear in every village of France and
every suburb of Paris.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">[193]</div>
<p>And Cluny, a suburb of Paris, is the scene
of this little opera. A juggler, curiously
enough named Jean, arrives in this village just
as the people have begun to celebrate May
Day in the square before the convent.</p>
<p>The juggler is welcomed. But one by one
his poor tricks are scorned. The people demand
a drinking song. The juggler is pious.
He fears to offend the Virgin. But at last, beseeching
the Virgin&rsquo;s forgiveness, he grants
their request.</p>
<p>Hearing the shouts of the crowd, the prior
of the monastery comes out to scatter the
crowd and rebuke the singer. He bids the poor
juggler repent and, putting the world at his
back, enter the monastery, never more to wander
over the beautiful hills of France.</p>
<p>In the juggler&rsquo;s poor mind occurs a great
struggle. And in this struggle these words are
wrung from his lips:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">[194]</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;But renounce, when I am still young,</p>
<p class="t0">Renounce to follow thee, oh, Liberty, beloved,</p>
<p class="t0">Careless fay with clear golden smile!</p>
<p class="t0">&rsquo;Tis she my heart for mistress has chosen;</p>
<p class="t0">Hair in the wind laughing, she takes my hand,</p>
<p class="t0">She drags me on chance of the hour and the road.</p>
<p class="t0">The silver of the waters, the gold of the blond harvest,</p>
<p class="t0">The diamonds of the nights, through her are mine!</p>
<p class="t0">I have space through her, and love and the world.</p>
<p class="t0">The villain, through her, becomes king!</p>
<p class="t0">By her divine charm, all smiles on me, all enchants,</p>
<p class="t0">And, to accompany the flight of my song,</p>
<p class="t0">The concert of the birds snaps in the green bush.</p>
<p class="t0">Gracious mistress and sister I have chosen.</p>
<p class="t0">Must I now lose you, oh, my royal treasure? Oh, Liberty, my beloved,</p>
<p class="t0">Careless fay of the golden smile!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Liberty ... careless fay of the golden
smile.&rdquo; Jeanne repeated these words three
times. Then with dreamy eyes that spanned
a nation and an ocean, she saw again the lanes,
the hedges, the happy villages of France.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who better than I can feel as that poor
juggler felt as he gave all this up for the monastery&rsquo;s
narrow walls?&rdquo; she asked. No answer
came back. She knew the answer well enough
for all that. And this knowledge gave her
courage for the hours that were to come.</p>
<p>She met Marjory Dean by one of the massive
pillars that adorn the great Opera House.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">[195]</div>
<p>&ldquo;To think,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;that all this
great building should be erected that thousands
might hear you sing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not me alone.&rdquo; The prima donna smiled.
&ldquo;Many, many others and many, I hope, more
worthy than I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a life you have had!&rdquo; the little
French girl cried rapturously. &ldquo;You have truly
lived!</p>
<p>&ldquo;To work, to dream, to hope,&rdquo; she went on,
&ldquo;to struggle onward toward some distant goal,
this is life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, no, my child.&rdquo; Marjory Dean&rsquo;s face
warmed with a kindly smile. &ldquo;This is not life.
It is but the beginning of life. One does not
work long, hope much, struggle far, before
he becomes conscious of someone on the way
before him. As he becomes conscious of this
one, the other puts out a hand to aid him forward.
Together they work, dream, hope and
struggle onward. Together they succeed more
completely.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">[196]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And then,&rdquo; her tone was mellow, thoughtful,
&ldquo;there comes the time when the one who
had been given the helping hand by one before
looks back and sees still another who struggles
bravely over the way he has come. His
other hand stretches back to this weaker one.
And so, with someone before to assist, with
one behind to be assisted, he works, dreams,
hopes and struggles on through his career, be
it long or short. And this, my child, is life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I see it now. I knew it before. But
one forgets. Watch me. I shall cling tightly
to your hand. And when my turn comes I
shall pray for courage and strength, then reach
back to one who struggles a little way behind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wise, brave child! How one could love
you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With this the prima donna threw her arm
across Jeanne&rsquo;s shoulder and together they
marched into the place of solemn enchantment,
an Opera House that is &ldquo;dark.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">[197]</div>
<h2 id="c21"><br />CHAPTER XXI
<br />FROM THE HEIGHTS TO DESPAIR</h2>
<p>&ldquo;To-day,&rdquo; said Marjory Dean, as they
came out upon the dimly lighted stage,
&ldquo;as you will see,&rdquo; she glanced about her where
the setting of a French village was to be seen
&ldquo;we are to rehearse &lsquo;The Juggler of Notre
Dame.&rsquo; And to-day, if you have the courage,
you may play the juggler in my stead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Jeanne&rsquo;s breath came short and quick.
Her wild heartbeats of anticipation had not
been in vain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the company!&rdquo; she exclaimed in a low
whisper. &ldquo;Shall they know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They will not be told. Many will guess
that something unusual is happening. But
they all are good sports. And besides they are
all of my&mdash;what is it you have called it?&mdash;my
&lsquo;Golden Circle.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, your &lsquo;Golden Circle.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">[198]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And those of our &lsquo;Golden Circle&rsquo; never betray
us. It is an unwritten law.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; Jeanne breathed deeply. &ldquo;Can I do
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly you can. And perhaps, on the
very next night when the &lsquo;Juggler&rsquo; is done&mdash;oh,
well, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. I know.&rdquo; Jeanne was fairly choking
with emotion.</p>
<p>When, however, half an hour later, garbed
as the juggler with his hoop and his bag of
tricks, she came before the troop of French
villagers of the drama, she was her own calm
self. For once again as in a dream, she trod
the streets of a beautiful French village. As
of yore she danced before the boisterous village
throng.</p>
<p>Only now, instead of stick and bear, she
danced with hoop and bag.</p>
<p>She was conscious at once that the members
of the company realized that she was a
stranger and not Marjory Dean.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">[199]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But I shall show them how a child of
France may play her native drama.&rdquo; At once
she lost herself in the character of Jean, the
wandering-juggler.</p>
<p>Eagerly she offered to do tricks with cup
and balls, to remove eggs from a hat.</p>
<p>Scorned by the throng, she did not despair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know the hoop dance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The children of the troop seized her by the
hands to drag her about. And Jeanne, the
lithe Jeanne who had so often enthralled thousands
by her fairy-like steps, danced clumsily
as the juggler must, then allowed herself to be
abused by the children until she could break
away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a glorious company!&rdquo; she was thinking
in the back of her mind. &ldquo;How they play
up to me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My lords,&rdquo; she cried when once more she
was free, &ldquo;to please you I&rsquo;ll sing a fine love
salvation song.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They paid her no heed. As the juggler she
did not despair.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">[200]</div>
<p>As Jeanne, she saw a movement in a seat
close to the opera pit. &ldquo;An auditor!&rdquo; Her heart
sank. &ldquo;What if it is someone who suspects
and will give me away!&rdquo; There was scant time
for these thoughts.</p>
<p>As the juggler she offered songs of battle,
songs of conquest, drama. To all this they
cried:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! No! Give us rather a drinking song!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At last yielding to their demand she sang:
&ldquo;Hallelujah, Sing the Hallelujah of Wine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then as the prior descended upon the
throng, scattering them like tiny birds before
a gale, she stood there alone, defenseless, as
the prior denounced her.</p>
<p>Real tears were in her eyes as she began her
farewell to the glorious liberty of hedge and
field, river, road and forest of France.</p>
<p>This farewell was destined to end unfinished
for suddenly a great bass voice roared:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is this? You are not Marjory Dean!
Where is she? What are you doing here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A huge man with a fierce black mustache
stood towering above her. She recognized in
him the director of the opera, and wished that
the section of the stage beneath her feet might
sink, carrying her from sight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">[201]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Here I am,&rdquo; came in a clear, cold tone. It
was Marjory Dean who spoke. She advanced
toward the middle of the stage.</p>
<p>Riveted to their places, the members of the
company stood aghast. Full well they knew
the fire that lay ever smouldering in Marjory
Dean&rsquo;s breast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what does this mean? Why are you
not rehearsing your part?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; Miss Dean replied evenly, &ldquo;I
chose to allow another, who can do it quite as
well, to rehearse with the company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I suppose,&rdquo; there was bitter sarcasm
in the director&rsquo;s voice, &ldquo;she will sing the part
when that night comes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if she did?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, Miss Dean, your services would no
longer be required.&rdquo; The man was purple with
rage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well.&rdquo; Marjory Dean&rsquo;s face went
white. &ldquo;We may as well&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">[202]</div>
<p>But Petite Jeanne was at her side. &ldquo;Miss
Dean, you do not know what you are saying.
It is not worth the cost. Please, please!&rdquo; she
pleaded with tears in her voice. &ldquo;Please forget
me. At best I am only a little French wanderer.
And you, you are the great Marjory
Dean!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reading the anguish in her upturned face,
Marjory Dean&rsquo;s anger was turned to compassion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another time, another place,&rdquo; she murmured.
&ldquo;I shall never forget you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Half an hour later the rehearsal was begun
once more. This time Marjory Dean was in
the stellar role. It was a dead rehearsal. All
the sparkle of it was gone. But it was a rehearsal
all the same, and the director had had
his way.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">[203]</div>
<h2 id="c22"><br />CHAPTER XXII
<br />THE ARMORED HORSE</h2>
<p>As for Jeanne, once more dressed as Pierre and
feeling like just no one at all, she
had gone wandering away into the shadows of
the orchestra floor, when suddenly she started.
Someone had touched her arm.</p>
<p>Until this moment she had quite forgotten
the lone auditor seated there in the dark. Now
as she bent low to look into that person&rsquo;s face
she started again as a name came to her lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rosemary Robinson!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is I,&rdquo; Rosemary whispered. &ldquo;I saw it all,
Pierre.&rdquo; She held Jeanne&rsquo;s hand in a warm
grasp. &ldquo;You were wonderful! Simply magnificent!
And the director. He was beastly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! No!&rdquo; Jeanne protested. &ldquo;He was but
doing his duty.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">[204]</div>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; Rosemary replied slowly, &ldquo;may be
true. But for all that you are a marvelous
&lsquo;Juggler of Notre Dame.&rsquo; And it is too bad
he found out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But come!&rdquo; she whispered eagerly, springing
to her feet. &ldquo;Why weep when there is so
much to be glad about? Let us go exploring!</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father,&rdquo; she explained, &ldquo;has done much
for this place. I have the keys to every room.
There are many mysteries. You shall see some
of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Seizing Jeanne&rsquo;s hand, she led the way
along a corridor, down two gloomy flights of
stairs and at last into a vast place where only
here and there a light burned dimly.</p>
<p>They were now deep down below the level
of the street. The roar and thunder of traffic
came to them only as a subdued rumble of
some giant talking in his sleep.</p>
<p>The room was immense. Shadows were
everywhere, shadows and grotesque forms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are we?&rdquo; Jeanne asked, scarcely
able to repress a desire to flee.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">[205]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It is one of the property rooms of the Opera
House. What will you have?&rdquo; Rosemary
laughed low and deep. &ldquo;Only ask for it. You
will find it here. All these things are used at
some time or another in the different operas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Jeanne&rsquo;s eyes became accustomed to the
pale half-light, she realized that this must be
nearly true. In a corner, piled tight in great
dark sections, was a miniature mountain.
Standing on edge, but spilling none of its
make-believe water, was a pond where swans
were wont to float.</p>
<p>A little way apart were the swans, resting
on great heaps of grass that did not wither
and flowers that did not die.</p>
<p>In a distant corner stood a great gray castle.
Someone had set it up, perhaps to make sure
that it was all intact, then had left it standing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a place for mystery!&rdquo; Jeanne exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and listen! Do you hear it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hear what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The river. We are far below the river. Listen.
Do you not hear it flowing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hear only the rumble of traffic.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">[206]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I only imagine it, but always when
I visit this place I seem to hear the river rushing
by. And always I think, &lsquo;What if the walls
should crumble?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they will not crumble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall hope not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But see.&rdquo; The rich girl&rsquo;s mood changed.
&ldquo;Here is a charger! Let us mount and ride!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She sprang toward a tall object completely
covered by a white cloth. When the cloth had
been dragged off, a great steed all clad in glittering
armor stood before them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come!&rdquo; Rosemary&rsquo;s voice rose high. &ldquo;Here
we are! You are a brave knight. I am a defenseless
lady. Give me your hand. Help me
to mount behind you. Then I will cling to you
while we ride through some deep, dark forest
where there are dragons and cross-bowmen
and all sorts of terrifying perils.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joining her in this spirit of make-believe,
Jeanne assisted her to the back of the
inanimate charger.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">[207]</div>
<p>Having touched some secret button, Rosemary
set the charger in motion. They were
riding now. Swaying from side to side, rising,
falling, they seemed indeed to be passing
through some dark and doleful place. As
Jeanne closed her eyes the illusion became
quite complete. As she felt Rosemary clinging
to her as she might cling to some gallant
knight, she forgot for the time that she was
Petite Jeanne and that she had suffered a dire
disappointment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am Pierre!&rdquo; she whispered to herself. &ldquo;I
am a brave knight. Rosemary loves me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The disquieting effect of this last thought
awakened her to the realities of life. Perhaps,
after all, Rosemary did love her a little as
Pierre. If this were true&mdash;</p>
<p>Sliding off the steed, then lifting Rosemary
to the floor, she exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come! Over yonder is a castle. Let us see
who is at home over there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Soon enough she was to see.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">[208]</div>
<p>The castle was, as all stage castles are, a
mere shell; very beautiful and grand on the
outside, a hollow echo within. For all that, the
two youthful adventurers found a certain joy
in visiting that castle. There was a rough
stairway leading up through great empty
spaces within to a broad, iron-railed balcony.
From this balcony, on more than one night,
an opera lover had leaned forth to sing songs
of high enchantment, luring forth a hidden
lover.</p>
<p>They climbed the stairs. Then Petite Jeanne,
caught by the spell of the place, leaned far out
of the window and burst into song, a wild
gypsy serenade.</p>
<p>Rosemary was leaning back among the
rafters, drinking in the sweet mystery of life
that was all about her, when of a sudden the
French girl&rsquo;s song broke off. Her face went
white for an instant as she swayed there and
must surely have fallen had not Rosemary
caught her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wha&mdash;what is it?&rdquo; she whispered hoarsely.</p>
<p>For a space of seconds there came no answer,
then a low whisper:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those eyes! I saw them. Those evil eyes.
Back of the mountain. They glared at me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eyes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The dark-faced man. He&mdash;he frightens me!
The way out! We must find it!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">[209]</div>
<p>Roused by her companion&rsquo;s fears, Rosemary
led the way on tiptoe down the stairs. Still in
silence they crossed the broad emptiness of the
castle, came to a rear door, tried it, felt it yield
to their touch, and passed through, only to
hear the intruder come racing down the stairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&mdash;he did not see us!&rdquo; Rosemary panted.
&ldquo;For now we are safe. This&mdash;come this way!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She crowded her way between a stairway
lying upon its side and a property porch.
Jeanne, whose heart was beating a tattoo
against her ribs, followed in silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a brave knight I am!&rdquo; she told herself,
and smiled in spite of her deathly fears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The way out,&rdquo; Rosemary whispered over
her shoulder. &ldquo;If I only can find that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A sound, from somewhere behind, startled
them into renewed effort.</p>
<p>Passing through a low forest of property
trees, they crossed a narrow bare space to find
themselves confronted by a more formidable
forest of chairs and tables. Chairs of all sorts,
with feet on the floor or high in air, blocked
their way.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">[210]</div>
<p>As Rosemary attempted to creep between
two great piles, one of these toppled to the
floor with a resounding crash.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come!&rdquo; Her tone was near despair. &ldquo;We
must find the way out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As for Jeanne, she was rapidly regaining
her composure. This was not the only time
she had been lost in an Opera House. The
Paris Opera had once held her a prisoner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes. The way out!&rdquo; She took the lead.
&ldquo;I think I see a light, a tiny red light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a second she hesitated. What was this
light? Was it held in the hand of the unwelcome
stranger? Was it an &ldquo;Exit&rdquo; light?</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the way out!&rdquo; she exulted. A quick
turn, a sharp cry and she went crashing forward.
Some object had lain in her path. She
had stumbled upon it in the dark.</p>
<p>What was it? This did not matter. All that
mattered were Rosemary and the way out.</p>
<p>Where was Rosemary? Leaping to her feet,
she glanced wildly about. A move from behind
demoralized her. One more wild dash and she
was beneath that red light. Before her was a
door. And at that door, pressing the knob,
was Rosemary.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">[211]</div>
<p>Next instant they had crowded through that
door.</p>
<p>But where were they? Narrow walls
hemmed them in on every side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a trap!&rdquo; Rosemary moaned.</p>
<p>Not so Jeanne. She pressed a button. They
were in a French elevator. They went up.</p>
<p>Up, up they glided. The light of a door
came, then faded, then another and yet another.</p>
<p>In consternation lest they crash at the top,
Jeanne pressed a second button. They came to
a sudden halt. A light shone above them. A
second, slower upward glide and they were
before still another door. The door swung
open. Still filled with wild panic, they
rushed into a room where all was dark, and
lost themselves in a perfect labyrinth where
costumes by hundreds hung in rows.</p>
<p>Crowded together, shoulder to shoulder,
with scarcely room to breathe, they stood
there panting, waiting, listening.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">[212]</div>
<p>Slowly their blood cooled. No sound came
to their waiting ears. Still Jeanne felt Rosemary&rsquo;s
heart beating wildly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To her I am a knight,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;I am
Pierre.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then a thought struck her all of a heap.
&ldquo;Perhaps I am not Pierre to her. She may
suspect. Yes, she may know!&rdquo; A cold chill
gripped her heart. &ldquo;If she finds out, what an
impostor she will believe me to be!</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; she thought more calmly, &ldquo;I
have meant no wrong. I only wanted to be
near the opera, to be ready for any great good
fortune that might befall me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Besides, how could she know? Who would
tell her? The lady in black? But how could
she know? No! No! My secret is safe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come!&rdquo; she whispered a moment later, &ldquo;I
think we have escaped from those most terrible
eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Creeping out, they made their way along a
corridor that welcomed them with ever-increasing
brightness until they stood before a
passenger elevator. A moment later they stood
in the clear bright light of late autumn afternoon.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">[213]</div>
<p>Throwing back her chest, the little French
girl, who for a moment was Pierre, drank in
three deep breaths, then uttered a long-drawn:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wh-e-w!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; said Rosemary, extending her hand
as she might had she been leaving a party, &ldquo;has
been delightful. So perfectly wonderful. Let&rsquo;s
do it again sometime.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One more thing!&rdquo; She whispered this.
&ldquo;They have never found my pearls. But it
really does not matter, at least not very much.
What are pearls among friends?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before Petite Jeanne could recover from her
surprise she was gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; she sighed as she turned to go
on her way, &ldquo;that some people have many terrible
adventures and want none, and some
have none but want many. What a crazy, upside-down
world this is, after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was well on her way home when a question,
coming into her mind with the force of
a blow, left her stunned.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">[214]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why did Rosemary say: &lsquo;The pearls have
not been found. It does not matter?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does she believe I took the pearls?&rdquo; she
asked herself, when she had partially recovered
her poise. &ldquo;And was she telling me I might
keep them?</p>
<p>&ldquo;How absurd! And yet, what did she mean?</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, after all, how could she help believing
that I took them? I ran away. There has been
no explanation. Unless&mdash;unless she knows
that I am Petite Jeanne and not Pierre! And
how could she know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>That night as, once more playing the role
of Pierre, she entered the boxes, she found
Jaeger, the detective, in his place. And, lurking
deep in the shadows was the lady in black.
She shuddered anew.</p>

<br />FLORENCE SOLVES A MYSTERY</h2>
<p>That night, by the light of a fickle moon
that ever and anon hid himself behind a
cloud, Florence made her way alone to the
shores of that curious island of &ldquo;made land&rdquo;
on the lake front. She had determined to delve
more deeply into the mysteries of this island.
On this night she was destined to make an astonishing
discovery.</p>
<p>It was not a promising place to wander, this
island. There, when the moon hid his face,
darkness reigned supreme.</p>
<p>Yet, even at such times as these, she was
not afraid. Strong as a man, endowed with
more than the average man&rsquo;s courage, she
dared many things. There were problems regarding
that island which needed solving. She
meant to solve them. Besides, the place was
gloriously peaceful, and Florence loved peace.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">[216]</div>
<p>She did not, however, love peace alone. She
yearned for all manner of excitement. Most of
all she was enchanted by sudden contrast. One
moment: silence, the moon, the stars, placid
waters, peace; the next: a sound of alarm,
darkness, the onrush of adventure and unsolved
mystery. This, for Florence, was
abundance of life.</p>
<p>She had come to the island to find peace.
But she would also probe into a mystery.</p>
<p>As she neared the southern end of the island
where stood the jungle of young cottonwood
trees, she paused to look away at the ragged
shore line. There, hanging above the rough
boulders, was Snowball&rsquo;s fishing derrick. Like
a slim, black arm, as if to direct the girl&rsquo;s
search out to sea, it pointed away toward black
waters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! No!&rdquo; Florence laughed low. &ldquo;Not
there. The mystery lies deep in the heart of
this young forest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Straight down the path she strode to find
herself standing at last before that challenging
door of massive oak.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">[217]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; she breathed. &ldquo;At home. They can&rsquo;t
deny it.&rdquo; Light was streaming through the
great round eyes above her.</p>
<p>Her heart skipped a beat as she lifted a hand
to rap on that door. What sort of people were
these, anyway? What was she letting herself
in for?</p>
<p>She had not long to wait. The door flew
open. A flood of white light was released.
And in that light Florence stood, open-mouthed,
speechless, staring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wa-all,&rdquo; came in a not unfriendly voice,
&ldquo;what is it y&rsquo; want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aunt&mdash;Aunt Bobby!&rdquo; Florence managed
to stammer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s me. And who may you be? Step
inside. Let me have a look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Florence! My own hearty Florence!&rdquo; The
aged woman threw two stout arms about the
girl&rsquo;s waist. &ldquo;And to think of you findin&rsquo; me
here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment the air was filled with exclamations
and ejaculations. After that, explanations
were in order.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">[218]</div>
<p>If you have read <i>The Thirteenth Ring</i>, you
will remember well enough that Aunt Bobby
was a ship&rsquo;s cook who had cooked her way up
and down one of the Great Lakes a thousand
times or more, and that on one memorable
journey she had acted as a fairy godmother to
one of Florence&rsquo;s pals. Florence had never forgotten
her, though their journeys had carried
them to different ports.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Aunt Bobby,&rdquo; she exclaimed at last,
&ldquo;what can you be doing here? And how did
such a strange home as this come into being?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all on account of her.&rdquo; Aunt Bobby
nodded toward a slim girl who, garbed in blue
overalls, sat beside the box-like stove. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s
my grandchild. Grew up on the ship, she did,
amongst sailors. Tie a knot and cast off a line
with the best of them, she can, and skin up a
mast better than most.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the captain would have it she must
have book learnin&rsquo;. So here we are, all high
and dry on land. And her a-goin&rsquo; off to school
every mornin&rsquo;. But when school is over, you
should see her&mdash;into every sort of thing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">[219]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes,&rdquo; she sighed, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s a problem, is
Meg!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meg, who might have been nearing sixteen,
smiled, crossed her legs like a man, and then
put on a perfect imitation of a sailor contemptuously
smoking a cob pipe&mdash;only there
was no pipe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This place, do you ask?&rdquo; Aunt Bobby went
on. &ldquo;Meg calls it the cathedral, she does, on
account of the pillars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Them pillars was lamp-posts once, broken
lamp-posts from the boulevard. Dumped out
here, they was. The captain and his men put
up the cathedral for us, where we could look
at the water when we liked. Part of it is from
an old ship that sank in the river and was
raised up, and part, like the pillars, comes from
the rubbish heap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do say, though, they made a neat job of it.
Meg&rsquo;ll show you her stateroom after a bit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But now, Meg, get down the cups. Coffee&rsquo;s
on the stove as it always was in the galleys.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">[220]</div>
<p>Florence smiled. She was liking this. Here
she was finding contrast. She thought of the
richly appointed Opera House where at this
moment Jeanne haunted the boxes; then she
glanced about her and smiled again.</p>
<p>She recalled the irrepressible Meg as she
had seen her, a bronze statue against the sky,
and resolved to know more of her.</p>
<p>As they sat dreaming over their coffee cups,
Aunt Bobby began to speak of the romance
of other days and to dispense with unstinting
hand rich portions from her philosophy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forty years I lived on ships, child.&rdquo; She
sighed deeply. &ldquo;Forty years! I&rsquo;ve sailed on
big ones and small ones, wind-jammers and
steamers. Some mighty fine ones and some not
so fine. Mostly I signed on freighters because
I loved them best of all. They haul and carry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re sort of human, ships are.&rdquo; She
cupped her chin in her hands to stare dreamily
at the fire. &ldquo;Sort of like folks, ships are.
Some are slim and pretty and not much use
except just to play around when the water&rsquo;s
sparklin&rsquo; and the sun shines bright. That&rsquo;s
true of folks and ships alike. And I guess it&rsquo;s
right enough. We all like pretty things.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">[221]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But the slow old freighter, smelling of
bilge and tar, she&rsquo;s good enough for me. She&rsquo;s
like the most of us common workers, carrying
things, doing the things that need to be done,
moving straight on through sunshine and
storm until the task is completed and the work
is done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, child, I&rsquo;ve sailed for forty years. I&rsquo;ve
watched the moon paint a path of gold over
waters blacker than the night. I&rsquo;ve heard the
ice screaming as it ground against our keel,
and I&rsquo;ve tossed all night in a storm that promised
every minute to send us to the bottom.
Forty years, child, forty years!&rdquo; The aged
woman&rsquo;s voice rose high and clear like the
mellow toll of a bell at midnight. &ldquo;Forty
years I&rsquo;ve felt the pitch and toss, the swell and
roll beneath me. And now this!&rdquo; She spread
her arms wide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ground beneath my feet, a roof over
my head.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">[222]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But not for long, child. Not for long. A
few months now, and a million pairs of feet
will tramp past the spot where you now stand.
What will these people see? Not the cathedral,
as Meg will call it, nothing half as grand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we, Meg and me, we&rsquo;ll move on. Fate
will point his finger and we&rsquo;ll move.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, well, that&rsquo;s life for most of us. Sooner
or later Fate points and we move. He&rsquo;s a
traffic cop, is Fate. We come to a pause. He
blows his whistle, he waves his arm. We move
or he moves us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, after all,&rdquo; she heaved a deep sigh that
was more than half filled with contentment,
&ldquo;who&rsquo;d object to that? Who wants to sit and
grow roots like stupid little cottonwood
trees?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">[223]</div>
<h2 id="c24"><br />CHAPTER XXIV
<br />THE BLACK PACKET</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Meg, show Florence your stateroom.&rdquo;
Aunt Bobby rose after her soliloquy.
&ldquo;Mine&rsquo;s more plain-like,&rdquo; she apologized. &ldquo;The
men set a heap of store on Meg, so they took
what was the stateroom of the captain in the
balmy days of that old ship and set it up for
Meg, right here on the island.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all there, walls and cabinet all done in
mahogany and gold, wide berth, and everything
grand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not like sleeping on the water with a
good hull beneath you.&rdquo; Meg&rsquo;s tone was almost
sullen. &ldquo;Just you wait! I&rsquo;m going
back!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">[224]</div>
<p>Once inside her stateroom her mood
changed. It became evident at once that she
was truly proud of this small room with its
costly decorations that had come down from
the past. Two great lanterns made of beaten
bronze hung one at the head and one at the
foot of her berth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s wonderful!&rdquo; Florence was truly impressed.
&ldquo;But this island, it is a lonely spot.
There must be prowlers about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes. All the time. Some good ones,
some bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But are you not afraid?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Afraid? No. I laugh at them. Why not?</p>
<p>&ldquo;And besides. Look!&rdquo; Her slender finger
touched a secret button. A cabinet door flew
open, revealing two revolvers. Their long blue
barrels shone wickedly in the light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you couldn&rsquo;t fire them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, couldn&rsquo;t I? Come over some day just
before dark, when the waves are making a lot
of noise. I&rsquo;ll show you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; she explained, &ldquo;I must be careful.
If the police heard, they&rsquo;d come and take
them from me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But on board ship!&rdquo; Her eyes danced. &ldquo;I
could out-shoot them all. You know how long
a freighter is?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">[225]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We used that for a shooting range. I could
out-shoot all the men. It was grand! If we
missed the target, the bullet went plump into
the sea! And that was all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said thoughtfully as she dropped
into a chair, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not afraid. There was one
man, though, who had me almost scared. His
face was so dark! He had such ugly eyes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dark face, ugly eyes!&rdquo; Florence recalled
Jeanne&rsquo;s description of the man who had
hounded her footsteps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I fooled him!&rdquo; Meg chuckled. &ldquo;I
fooled him twice. And I laughed in his face,
too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rising, she pressed a second button in the
wall to reveal still another secret compartment.
&ldquo;See that!&rdquo; She pointed to a black
packet. &ldquo;That was his. It&rsquo;s mine now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder why he put it where he did?&rdquo; she
mused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In Snowball&rsquo;s net.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">[226]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what he did. I was sitting alone
among the rocks at night. He came out, acting
mysterious. He poured two buckets of
water on Snowball&rsquo;s windlass so it wouldn&rsquo;t
creak and then he threw this package into the
net and lowered away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is heavy. Went right to the bottom. I
slipped into the water and went after it. Got
it, too. See! There it is!</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do you know,&rdquo; her voice fell to an excited
whisper, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s to be my birthday present
to myself. It&rsquo;s to be my surprise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surprise! Haven&rsquo;t you unwrapped it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Why should I? That would spoil my
fun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence looked at this slim girl in overalls,
and smiled. &ldquo;You surely are an unusual child!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He came back next day.&rdquo; Meg ignored
this last. &ldquo;He made Snowball dive down and
look for his package. He didn&rsquo;t find it. The
man was angry. His face got blacker than
ever, and how his eyes snapped! An ugly red
scar showed on his chin. Then I laughed, and
he chased me.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">[227]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I dropped into the water and came up
where there is a hole like a sea grotto. I
watched him until he went away. He never
came back. So now this is mine!&rdquo; Pride of
ownership was in her voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But ought you not to open the package?
It may have been stolen. It may contain valuables,
watches, diamonds, pearls.&rdquo; Florence
was thinking of the lost necklace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ought!&rdquo; Meg&rsquo;s face was twisted into a
contemptuous frown. &ldquo;Ought! That&rsquo;s a landlubber&rsquo;s
word. You never hear it on a ship.
Many things <i>must</i> be done&mdash;hatch battened
down, boilers stoked, bells rung. Lots of things
<i>must</i> be done. But nothing merely <i>ought</i> to be
done. No! No! I want to save it for my birthday.
And I shall!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that she snapped the cabinet door shut,
then led the way out of her stateroom.</p>
<p>Ten minutes later Florence was on the dark
winding path on her way home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What an unusual child!&rdquo; she thought. And
again, &ldquo;I wonder who that man could be?
What does that packet contain?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">[228]</div>
<h2 id="c25"><br />CHAPTER XXV
<br />THE BEARDED STRANGER</h2>
<p>Though that which happened to Jeanne
on this very night could scarcely be called
an adventure, it did serve to relieve the feeling
of depression which had settled upon her
like a cloud after that dramatic but quite terrible
moment when the irate director had
driven her from the stage. It did more than
this; it gave her a deeper understanding of
that mystery of mysteries men call life.</p>
<p>Between acts she stood contemplating her
carefully creased trousers and the tips of her
shiny, patent leather shoes. Suddenly she became
conscious that someone was near, someone
interested in her. A sort of sixth sense,
a gypsy sense, told her that eyes were upon
her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">[229]</div>
<p>As her own eyes swept about a wide circle,
they took in the bearded man with large, luminous
eyes. He was standing quite near.
With sudden impulse, she sprang toward him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please tell me.&rdquo; Her voice was eager.
&ldquo;Why did you say all this was &lsquo;a form of life&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That question,&rdquo; the man spoke slowly, &ldquo;can
best be answered by seeing something other
than this. Would you care to go a little way
with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jeanne gave him a quick look. She was a
person of experience, this little French girl.
&ldquo;He can be trusted,&rdquo; her heart assured her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I am working.&rdquo; Her spirits dropped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are extra ushers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will have one called.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This man has influence here,&rdquo; Jeanne
thought a moment later, as, side by side, they
left the building. &ldquo;Who can he be?&rdquo; Her interest
increased tenfold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will go this way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They turned west, went over the bridge,
crossed the street to the south, then turned
west again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">[230]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but this&mdash;this is rather terrible!&rdquo;
Jeanne protested. Scarcely five minutes had
passed. They had left the glitter and glory of
jewels, rich silks and costly furs behind. Now
they were passing through throngs of men.
Roughly clad men they were, many in rags.
Their faces were rough and seamed, their
hands knotted and blue with cold. Jeanne
drew her long coat tightly about her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one will harm you.&rdquo; Her strange companion
took her arm.</p>
<p>The street setting was as drab as were those
who wandered there: cheap movies displaying
gaudy posters, cheaper restaurants where one
might purchase a plate of beans and a cup of
coffee for a dime. The wind was rising. Picking
up scraps of paper and bits of straw, it sent
them in an eddy, whirling them round and
round. Like dead souls in some lost world,
these bits appeared to find no place to rest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See!&rdquo; said her companion. &ldquo;They are like
the men who wander here; they have no resting
place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jeanne shuddered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">[231]</div>
<p>But suddenly her attention was arrested by
a falling object that was neither paper nor
straw, but a pigeon.</p>
<p>One glance assured her that this was a
young bird, fully grown and feathered, who
had not yet learned to fly. He fluttered hopelessly
on the sidewalk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A beautiful bird,&rdquo; was her thought. &ldquo;Such
lovely plumage!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A passer-by with an ugly, twisted face
leered up at her as he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something to eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jeanne did not finish. To her utter astonishment
she saw that a very short man in a long
greasy coat had captured the pigeon, tucked
it under his coat and was making off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&mdash;he won&rsquo;t eat it?&rdquo; she gasped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come. We will follow.&rdquo; Her companion
hurried her along.</p>
<p>The short man, with the bird still under his
arm, had turned south into a dark and deserted
street. Jeanne shuddered and wished to turn
back. Then she thought of the pigeon. &ldquo;He
is beautiful even now,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;What
must he be when he gets his second plumage?
How proudly he will strut upon the roof-tops.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_232">[232]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me truly,&rdquo; she said to her companion,
&ldquo;he would not eat him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There came no answer.</p>
<p>Having traveled two blocks south, they
crossed the street to find themselves facing a
vacant lot. There, amid piles of broken bricks
and rusty heaps of sheet-iron, many camp fires
burned. Moving about from fire to fire, or sitting
huddled about them, were men. These
were more ragged and forlorn, if that were
possible, than those she had seen upon the
street.</p>
<p>Then, with the force of a bullet, truth entered
the very heart of her being. These men
were derelicts. These piles of broken bricks
and rusting iron were their homes; these camp
fires their kitchens. Soon the young pigeon
would be simmering in a great tin can filled
with water.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">[233]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; she cried, leaping forward and
seizing the short man by the arm. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t&mdash;don&rsquo;t
cook him! I will pay you for him. Here!
Here is a dollar. Is that enough? If not, I
have another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blinking back at her in surprise, taking in
her long coat, her jaunty cap, the man stared
at her in silence. Then, as the bearded man
hurried up, he blinked at him in turn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to eat him,&rdquo; he protested.
&ldquo;Honest I didn&rsquo;t. But if you want him&mdash;&rdquo; he
eyed the dollar bill eagerly &ldquo;&mdash;if you want him,
here he is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thrusting the pigeon into Jeanne&rsquo;s hands,
he seized the bill and muttered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;A dollar&mdash;a dollar, a whole cartwheel, one
big iron man! I didn&rsquo;t know there was one
left in the world!&rdquo; He seemed about to shed
tears.</p>
<p>As he turned his face up to Jeanne&rsquo;s she noticed
that he had but one eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo; the bearded one
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mostly they call me the one-eyed shrimp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pocketing the money, he walked away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This, too,&rdquo; said the bearded one solemnly,
&ldquo;is a form of life.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">[234]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But why such cruel, cruel contrasts?&rdquo; In
her mind&rsquo;s eye Jeanne was seeing jewels, silks
and furs. There were tears in her voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To that question no answer has been
found,&rdquo; the bearded man answered solemnly.
&ldquo;The world is very old. It has always been
so. Perhaps it is necessary. It gives contrast.
Lights and shadows. We must have them or
nothing could be seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am a sculptor, a very poor one, but one
nevertheless. Perhaps you may visit my
studio. There you will find things I have done
in lovely white marble, yet the beauty of the
marble can only be brought out by shadows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come! You are cold.&rdquo; He turned Jeanne
about. &ldquo;We will go back to the Opera House.
Always we must be going back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Strange as it may seem, Jeanne did not wish
to return. That magnificent palace of art and
song had suddenly become abhorrent to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The contrasts,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;they are
too great!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">[235]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. There you have discovered a great
truth. Come to my studio some day. I will
show you more.&rdquo; The bearded one pressed a
card into her hand. Without looking at it, she
thrust it deep into her trousers pocket.</p>
<p>In silence they returned to the Opera House.
Once inside, Jeanne experienced a miracle.
The dark, cold, bitter world outside had vanished.
In her mind, for the moment, not a
trace of it remained. For her, now, there was
only light and life, melody, color&mdash;romance in
fact, and opera at its best.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">[236]</div>
<h2 id="c26"><br />CHAPTER XXVI
<br />AN EXCITING MESSAGE</h2>
<p>Petite Jeanne was a sun-worshipper
and a fire-worshipper of the best sort. She
worshipped the One Who created fire and Who
sends us light to dispel the gloom of night.
The day following her unusual experiences
in the lower regions of the Opera House found
her curled up in a big chair. The chair stood
before a large window of their living room.
Here she was completely flooded with light.
On bright days, for a space of two hours, the
sunlight always succeeded in finding its way
through the labyrinth of chimneys and skyscrapers,
to fall like a benediction upon this
blonde-haired girl. And Jeanne rejoiced in it
as a kitten does the warm spot before the
hearth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s God looking down upon His world,&rdquo;
she murmured now.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_237">[237]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Jeanne,&rdquo; Florence stood in the door of her
room, &ldquo;did that man, the dark-faced one with
the evil eye, did he have a scar on his chin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Y-e-s. Let me see.&rdquo; She closed her eyes to
invite a picture. It came. &ldquo;Yes, now I see him
as I did only yesterday. Yes, there was a
scar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You saw him yesterday?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reluctantly Jeanne turned her face from the
sunlight. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you about it. It was exciting,
and&mdash;and a bit terrible. What can he
want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She told Florence about the previous day&rsquo;s
adventure. &ldquo;But why did you ask about the
scar?&rdquo; It was her turn to ask questions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was out at the island last night. You&rsquo;d
never dream of the discovery I made there.
But then, you&rsquo;ve never seen Aunt Bobby&mdash;probably
not so much as heard of her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence had described her experiences up
to the time when Meg invited her to inspect
her stateroom, when the phone rang.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll answer it.&rdquo; Florence took down the receiver.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_238">[238]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s for you,&rdquo; she said, half a minute later.</p>
<p>With a deep sigh Jeanne deserted her spot
in the sun.</p>
<p>For all that, her face was flushed with excitement
when she put the receiver down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the little old lady of the cameo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In her excitement she found herself talking
in a hoarse whisper. &ldquo;She has persuaded Hop
Long Lee, the rich Chinaman, to let us see the
magic curtain. Better still, his people will
stage a little play for us. They will use the
magic curtain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Next Friday, at midnight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Midnight? What an hour!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Night is best. And what other hour could
one be sure of? There is Marjory Dean. She
must see it. And we must find Angelo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Angelo? Have you seen him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not for months. He went to New York to
make his fortune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Angelo, as you will recall, was the youthful
dreamer who had created a fascinating light
opera role for Jeanne.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_239">[239]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But only two days ago,&rdquo; Jeanne went on,
&ldquo;I heard that he had been seen here in the
city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here? Why does he not give us a ring?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who knows?&rdquo; Jeanne shrugged. &ldquo;For all
that, I will find him. He must come.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And to think!&rdquo; She did a wild fling across
the room. &ldquo;We are to see the magic curtain.
We will weave an opera about it. The opera
shall be played on that so grand stage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By whom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jeanne did not hesitate. &ldquo;By Marjory Dean!
She will have the leading role. I shall insist.
And why not? Would she not do so much for
me? Truly. And more, much more!</p>
<p>&ldquo;As for me!&rdquo; Again she settled herself in
the spot of sunlight. &ldquo;My time will come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She might have added, &ldquo;Sooner than you
could dream of.&rdquo; She did not.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_240">[240]</div>
<h2 id="c27"><br />CHAPTER XXVII
<br />DREAMING</h2>
<p>Angelo must be found. It was he who
had written the successful light opera,
<i>The Gypsy God of Fire</i>. No other could write
as he&mdash;or so Jeanne thought. Yes, he must be
found, and that without delay. Friday midnight
would be here before anyone could
dream three dreams.</p>
<p>And where was one to look for him save in
his old haunts? &ldquo;His garret studio and at
night,&rdquo; Jeanne said to Florence, next morning.
&ldquo;To-morrow we will go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But to-morrow I cannot go. My work
keeps me out late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, well, then I shall go alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you not afraid to be on the streets at
night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As Pierre I am afraid. But I shall be Petite
Jeanne. As Jeanne I shall be safe enough.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_241">[241]</div>
<p>Knowing the futility of an argument with
this strange child of France, Florence smiled
and went on her way.</p>
<p>That is how it came about that Jeanne found
herself at a late hour climbing the stairway
that led to the garret studio that once had witnessed
so much lightness and gaiety.</p>
<p>She had expected to find changes. Times
were hard. It had come to her, in indirect
ways, that her good friend had met with little
success in New York. But she was scarcely
prepared for that which met her gaze as the
door was thrown open by Angelo himself.</p>
<p>Advancing into the center of the room, she
found bare floors where there had been bright,
rich, Oriental rugs. The unique stage, with all
its settings of blue, green, red and gold, was
bare.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Angelo spoke slowly, meditatively, as
if answering her mood, &ldquo;they took my things,
one at a time. Fair enough, too. I owed
money. I could not pay. The piano went first,
my old, old friend. A battered friend it was,
but its tones were true.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_242">[242]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And what grand times we had around that
piano! Remember?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember.&rdquo; Jeanne&rsquo;s tone was low.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But don&rsquo;t be sad about it.&rdquo; Angelo was
actually smiling. &ldquo;They took the piano, the
rugs, the desk where I composed your light
opera.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes; but after all, these are but the
symbols of life. They are not life itself. They
could not carry away the memory of those
days, those good brave days when we were
sometimes rich and sometimes very, very poor.
The memories of those days will be with us
forever. And of such memories as these life,
the best of life, is made.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After some brief, commonplace remarks,
came a moment of silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll excuse me,&rdquo; Swen, Angelo&rsquo;s friend,
said, &ldquo;I will go out to search for a bit of cheer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes. He will bring us cheer. Then he
will sing us a song.&rdquo; Jeanne made a brave attempt
at being merry.</p>
<p>When Swen was gone, Angelo motioned
her to a place before the fire.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_243">[243]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We will not despair. &lsquo;Hope springs eternal
in the human breast.&rsquo; The beautiful spring-time
of life will bloom again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And see,&rdquo; he exclaimed, enthusiastic as a
boy, &ldquo;we still have the fireplace! They could
not take that. And there is always wood to
be had. I found this on the beach. It was
washed up high in the storm at a spot where
children romp all summer long. Driftwood.
Some from a broken ship and some from who
knows where?</p>
<p>&ldquo;See how it burns. The flame! The flame!&rdquo;
He was all but chanting now. &ldquo;What colors
there are! Can you see them? There is red
and orange, pink, purple, blue. All like a miniature
magic curtain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, like a magic curtain,&rdquo; Jeanne murmured.</p>
<p>Then suddenly she awoke from the entrancing
spell this remarkable youth had woven.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes, but those brave days will return
for you!&rdquo; she cried, springing to her feet and
leaping away in a wild dance. &ldquo;The magic
curtain, it will bring them back to you!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_244">[244]</div>
<p>His fine eyes shone as he rose to admire the
grace of her rhythmic dance. &ldquo;Now you are
dreaming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dreaming?&rdquo; She stopped dead still. &ldquo;Perhaps.
But my dreams will come true. Allow
me to congratulate you. You are about to become
famous. You will write a grand opera.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! The gypsy fortune teller speaks.&rdquo; He
still smiled. Nevertheless he held her hand in
a warm clasp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she agreed, &ldquo;I am a gypsy, a fortune
teller. Well, perhaps. But, for all that, I only
speak of things I have seen. Listen, my good
friend!&rdquo; Her tone was impressive. &ldquo;I have
seen that which will form the background for
an Oriental opera. Not a long opera, one act
perhaps; but an opera, vivid and living, all the
same. And you, my friend, shall write it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You talk in riddles.&rdquo; He drew her to a
seat beside him. &ldquo;Explain, my beautiful
gypsy.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_245">[245]</div>
<p>&ldquo;This much I shall tell you, not more. I
have seen a magic curtain that burns but is
not consumed. Friday at midnight you shall
see it for yourself. And about it you shall
weave a story more fantastic than any you
have yet dreamed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you shall be the leading lady!&rdquo; He
had caught the spirit of the hour. &ldquo;That shall
be glory. Glory for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, no, my friend.&rdquo; Petite Jeanne&rsquo;s head
drooped a little. &ldquo;I am not known to grand
opera. But you shall have a leading lady, such
a grand lady! Marjory Dean! What do you
say to that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right.&rdquo; Angelo&rsquo;s tone was solemn.
&ldquo;She is very grand, marvelous indeed. But,
after all, we work best, we write best, we do
all things best for those who love us a little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, you would say that!&rdquo; Jeanne seized
him by the shoulder and gave him a gentle
shake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But see!&rdquo; she cried when she had regained
her composure. &ldquo;Marjory Dean, too, is to see
the magic curtain. To-morrow at midnight,
you shall see her. And then I am sure she will
love you more than a little. Then all will be
more than well.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_246">[246]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And now see! Here is Swen. He is bringing
hot coffee and sweet rolls stuffed, I am
sure, with pineapple and fresh cocoanut. On
with the feast!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Angelo produced two ancient plates and
three large cups devoid of handles. They settled
themselves comfortably before the hearth
to enjoy such a communion of good spirits as
had never been granted them in those balmy
days when purses were lined with gold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is poverty when one has friends?&rdquo;
Angelo demanded joyously, as at last he assisted
Jeanne to her feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, indeed?&rdquo; Jeanne agreed heartily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Friday at midnight,&rdquo; Angelo said solemnly,
as a moment later Jeanne stood at the doorway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As the clock strikes the hour,&rdquo; she
breathed. Then she was gone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_247">[247]</div>
<h2 id="c28"><br />CHAPTER XXVIII
<br />FLORENCE CRASHES IN</h2>
<p>At that moment Florence was involved in
an affair which threatened to bring her
brief career to a tragic end.</p>
<p>It had begun innocently enough. The back
of a man&rsquo;s head, seen in a crowd, had interested
her. She had made a study of men&rsquo;s
heads. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s as much character to be read
in the back of one&rsquo;s head as in one&rsquo;s face,&rdquo; a
psychologist had said to her. Doubting his
statement, she had taken up this study to disprove
his theory. She had ended by believing.
For truly one may read in the carriage of the
head stubbornness, indecision, mental and
physical weakness; yes, and a capacity for
crime.</p>
<p>It was this last, revealed in the neck of the
man in the throng, that had set her on his
trail.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_248">[248]</div>
<p>She had not long to wait for confirmation.
At a turn in the street the man offered her a
side view. At once she caught her breath.
This man was dark of visage. He had an ugly
red scar on his chin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jeanne&rsquo;s shadow!&rdquo; she whispered to herself.
&ldquo;And such a shadow!&rdquo; She shuddered at
the very thought.</p>
<p>For this young man was not unknown to
her. Not ten days before, in a crowded police
court he had been pointed out to her as one
of the most dangerous of criminals. He was
not, at this time, in custody. Just why he was
there she had not been told. Though suspected
of many crimes, he had been detected
in none of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it is he who has been dogging Jeanne&rsquo;s
footsteps!&rdquo; she muttered. &ldquo;I must warn her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He, too, it was, who sank the package in
Snowball&rsquo;s net. Meg&rsquo;s birthday present.&rdquo; She
smiled. Then she frowned. &ldquo;I must warn her.
It may be a bomb. Stranger discoveries have
been made.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_249">[249]</div>
<p>For a moment she considered another
theory regarding the package. A moment only&mdash;then
all this was driven from her mind.
Drama was in the making, real drama from
life. The evil-eyed one had paused before a
doorway. He had remained poised there for
a moment like a bird of prey: then the prey
appeared, or so it seemed to Florence.</p>
<p>A short, foreign-appearing man with a military
bearing all but came to a position of
salute before the dark one of the evil eye. That
one essayed a smile which, to the girl, seemed
the grin of a wolf.</p>
<p>The short man appeared not to notice. He
uttered a few words, waved his hands excitedly,
then turned as if expecting to be led away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A Frenchman,&rdquo; Florence thought. &ldquo;Who
else would wave his arms so wildly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then a thought struck her all of a heap.
&ldquo;This is Jeanne&rsquo;s little Frenchman, the one
who bears a message for her, who has come
all the way from France to deliver it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_250">[250]</div>
<p>At once she became wildly excited. She had
notions about that message. Strangely fantastic
notions they were; this she was obliged
to admit. But they very nearly drove her to
committing a strange act. In a moment more
she would have dashed up to the little Frenchman.
She would undoubtedly have seized him
by the arm and exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are looking for Petite Jeanne. Come!
I will lead you to her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This did not happen. There was a moment
of indecision. Then, before her very eyes, the
dark one, after casting a suspicious glance her
way, bundled his prey into a waiting taxi and
whisked him away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone!&rdquo; Consternation seized her. But,
suddenly, her mind cleared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was that number?&rdquo; She racked her
brain. Tom Howe, the young detective who
had pointed out the dark-faced one, had given
her the street number believed to be his hangout.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One, three,&rdquo; she said aloud. &ldquo;One, three,
six, four, Burgoyne Place. That was it!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, taxi! Taxi!&rdquo; She went dashing away
after a vacant car.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_251">[251]</div>
<p>Having overtaken the cab, she gave the
driver hasty instructions, and then settled back
against the cushions.</p>
<p>Her head was in a whirl. What was it she
planned to do? To follow a dangerous
criminal? Alone? To frustrate his plans
single-handed? The thing seemed tremendous,
preposterous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably not going to his haunt at all.
May not be his haunt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pressing her hands against her temples, she
closed her eyes. For a space of several moments
she bumped along.</p>
<p>Then she straightened up. The cab had
ceased its bumping. They were rolling along
on smooth paving. This was not to be expected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Driver! Driver!&rdquo; she exclaimed, sliding
the glass window to one side with a bang.
&ldquo;Where are we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kinzie and Carpen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, oh!&rdquo; She could have wept. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
going north. The address I gave you is south.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be, Miss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_252">[252]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;m wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course! Turn about and go south to
2200. Then I&rsquo;ll tell you the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once again they glided and jolted along.
In the end they pulled up before a stone building.
A two-story structure that might once
have been a mansion, it stood between two
towering warehouses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the place. There&rsquo;s the number.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She hesitated. Should she ask the driver to
remain? &ldquo;No, they&rsquo;ll see him and make a run
for it.&rdquo; She had thought of a better way.
She paid him and as if frightened by his surroundings
he sped away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a moment to lose!&rdquo; she whispered.
Some sixth sense seemed to tell her that this
was the place&mdash;that the dark one and his victim
were inside.</p>
<p>Speeding to a corner where a boy cried his
papers, she thrust half a dollar into his hand,
and whispered a command:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bring a policeman to that house!&rdquo; She
poked a thumb over her shoulder.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_253">[253]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll need three of &rsquo;em!&rdquo; the boy muttered,
as he hurried away. She did not hear.
She was speeding back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now!&rdquo; she breathed, squaring her shoulders.</p>
<p>Up the stone steps, a thrust at the doorbell.
Ten seconds. No answer. A vigorous thump.
A kick. Still no response.</p>
<p>Examining the door, she found it to be a
double one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rusty catches. Easy!</p>
<p>&ldquo;But then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did not stand on ceremony. Stepping
back a pace, she threw her sturdy form against
the door. It gave way, letting her into a hallway.
To the right of the hallway was a door.</p>
<p>A man was in the act of springing at her
when someone from behind exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait! It&rsquo;s a frail!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The words appeared to upset the other&rsquo;s
plans, or at least to halt them for a second.</p>
<p>During that second the girl plunged head
foremost. Striking him amidships, she capsized
him and took all the wind from his sail in
one and the same instant.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_254">[254]</div>
<p>She regained her balance just in time to see
a long, blue gun being leveled at her. It was
in the hand of the evil-eyed one.</p>
<p>Not for naught had she labored in the gymnasium.
Before the gun flashed, it went whirling
through space, crashed a window and was
gone.</p>
<p>As for the evil-eyed one, he too vanished.
At the same moment three stolid policemen
came stamping in. The newsboy had done
yeoman duty.</p>
<p>The offender who had been overturned by
Florence was duly mopped up. The evil-eyed
one was sought in vain. Groaning in a corner
was the short Frenchman.</p>
<p>His arms were bound behind him in a curious
fashion; in fact they were so bound by
ropes and a stick that his arms might have
been twisted from their sockets, and this by
a few simple turns of that stick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kidnappin&rsquo; an&rsquo; torture!&rdquo; said one of the
police, standing the captured offender on his
feet. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll get yours, Mike.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was Blackie&rsquo;s idea,&rdquo; grumbled the man.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_255">[255]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And where&rsquo;s Blackie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man shrugged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Left you to hold the bag. That&rsquo;s him. Anyway,
now we got it on him, we&rsquo;ll mop him up!
Blamed if we don&rsquo;t! Tim, untie that man.&rdquo;
He nodded toward the little Frenchman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now then,&rdquo; the police sergeant commanded,
&ldquo;tell us why you let &rsquo;em take you in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&mdash;they told me they would take me to
a person known as Petite Jeanne.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pet&mdash;Petite Jeanne!&rdquo; Florence could have
shouted for joy. &ldquo;And have you money for
her, a great deal of money?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Miss.&rdquo; The little man stared at her.</p>
<p>Florence wilted. Her pet dream had proven
only an illusion. &ldquo;At any rate,&rdquo; she managed
to say after a time, &ldquo;when the police are
through with you I&rsquo;ll take you to her lodgings.
I am her friend and pal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little man looked at her distrustfully.
He had put his confidence in two American
citizens that day, and with dire results.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see about that later.&rdquo; The police
sergeant scowled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_256">[256]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I think&mdash;&rdquo; His scowl had turned to a
smile when, a few moments later, after completing
his investigation and interrogating
Florence, he turned to the Frenchman. &ldquo;I
think&mdash;at least it&rsquo;s my opinion&mdash;that you&rsquo;ll be
safe enough in this young lady&rsquo;s company.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If she&rsquo;d go to the trouble of hirin&rsquo; a taxi
and followin&rsquo; you, then breakin&rsquo; down a door
and riskin&rsquo; her life to rescue you from a bloody
pair of kidnappers and murderers, she&rsquo;s not
goin&rsquo; to take you far from where you want to
go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am overcome!&rdquo; The Frenchman bowed
low. &ldquo;I shall accompany her with the greatest
assurance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, side by side, the curious little Frenchman
and the girl marched away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Mademoiselle!&rdquo; The Frenchman
seemed dazed. &ldquo;Why all this late unpleasantness?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those two!&rdquo; Florence threw out her arms.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;d have tortured you to death. They
thought, as I did, that you were in possession
of money, a great deal of money.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_257">[257]</div>
<p>&ldquo;In France,&rdquo; the man exclaimed in evident
disgust, &ldquo;we execute such men!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In America,&rdquo; Florence replied quietly, &ldquo;we
mostly don&rsquo;t. And what a pity!</p>
<p>&ldquo;The elevated is only three blocks away.&rdquo;
She took up a brisk stride. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take it. I
hate taxis. Drivers never know where you
want to go. Outside the Loop, they&rsquo;re lost
like babes in the wood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A taxi might indeed have lost both Florence
and the polite little Frenchman. Under
Florence&rsquo;s plan only the Frenchman was lost.
And this, to her, was just as bad, for she <i>did</i>
want Petite Jeanne to meet this man and receive
the message from him, even though the
message was not to be delivered in the form
of bank notes.</p>
<p>It was the little man&rsquo;s extreme politeness
that proved his undoing. In the Loop they
were obliged to change trains. Florence had
waited for the right train, and then had invited
him to go before her, when, with a lift
of his hat, he said, bowing:</p>
<p>&ldquo;After you, my dear Mademoiselle!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_258">[258]</div>
<p>This was all well enough. But there were
other Madams and Mademoiselles boarding
that train.</p>
<p>Again and yet again the little man bowed
low. When at last the gates banged and the
train rattled on its way, Florence found to her
consternation that she was alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We left him there bowing!&rdquo; There was a
certain humor in the situation. But she was
disappointed and alarmed.</p>
<p>Speeding across the bridge at the next station,
she boarded a second train and went rattling
back. Arrived at her former station, she
found no trace of the man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He took another train. It&rsquo;s no use.&rdquo; Her
shoulders drooped. &ldquo;All that and nothing for
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her dejection lasted but for a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;It is not far
away. And on the morrow there is ever something
new.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_259">[259]</div>
<h2 id="c29"><br />CHAPTER XXIX
<br />IT HAPPENED AT MIDNIGHT</h2>
<p>Midnight. The lights of Chinatown
were dim as four figures made their
way to a door marked: &ldquo;For Members Only.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jeanne, the foremost of these figures, knew
that door. She had entered it before. Yet, as
her hand touched the heavy handle, she was
halted by a sudden fear. Her face blanched.</p>
<p>Close at her side Marjory Dean, artist and
supreme interpreter of life as she was, understood
instantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, child. Don&rsquo;t be afraid. They are a
simple people, these Orientals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Yes, I know.&rdquo; The girl took a tight
grip on herself and pressed on through the
door. Marjory Dean, Angelo and Swen followed.</p>
<p>At the top of the second stair they were
halted by a dark shadow-like figure.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_260">[260]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What you want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hop Long Lee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man, whose footsteps made not the
slightest sound, led the way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Midnight,&rdquo; Jeanne whispered to herself.
&ldquo;Why did I say midnight?&rdquo; It was always so.
Ever she was desiring mystery, enchantment
at unheard-of hours. Always, when the hour
came she was ready to turn back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The magic curtain.&rdquo; She started. A second
dark figure was beside her. &ldquo;You wished
to see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Y-yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall see. I am Hop Long Lee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And these are your friends? Ah, yes!
Come! You will see!&rdquo; His hand touched
Jeanne&rsquo;s. She started back. It was cold, like
marble.</p>
<p>They followed in silence. They trod inch-thick
rugs. There came no sound save the
tok-tok-tok of some great, slow clock off there
somewhere in the dark.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_261">[261]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I am not afraid,&rdquo; Jeanne told herself. &ldquo;I
am not going to be afraid. I have seen all this
before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yet, when she had descended the narrow,
winding stairs, when a small, Oriental rug was
offered her in lieu of a chair, her limbs gave
way beneath her and she dropped, limp as a
rag, to the comforting softness of the rug.</p>
<p>That which followed will remain painted on
the walls of never-to-be-forgotten memories.</p>
<p>Figures, dark, creeping figures, appeared in
this dimly lighted room.</p>
<p>Once again the curtain, a red and glowing
thing, crept across the stage. She gripped
Marjory Dean&rsquo;s hand hard.</p>
<p>Some figures appeared before the curtain.
Grotesque figures. They danced as she had
imagined only gnomes and elves might dance.
A vast, many-colored dragon crept from the
darkness. With a mighty lashing of tail, he
swallowed the dancers, then disappeared into
the darkness from which he had come.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Jeanne breathed. Even Marjory
Dean, who had witnessed many forms of
magic, was staring straight ahead.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_262">[262]</div>
<p>A single figure appeared on the stage, one
all in white. The figure wore a long, flowing
robe. The face was white.</p>
<p>From somewhere strange music began to
whisper. It was like wind sighing in the trees,
the trees in the graveyard at midnight. And
this was midnight.</p>
<p>Next instant Jeanne leaped straight into the
air. Someone had struck a gong, an Oriental
gong.</p>
<p>Mortified beyond belief, she settled back in
her place.</p>
<p>And now the magic curtain, like some wall
of fire, burned a fiercer red. From the shadows
the dragon thrust out his head once more.</p>
<p>The white-faced figure ceased dancing.
The wind in the trees sang on. The figure,
appearing to see the dragon, drew back in
trembling fright.</p>
<p>He approached the fiery curtain, yet his
back was ever toward it. There was yet a
space between the two sections of the curtain.
The figure, darting toward this gap, was
caught in the flames.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_263">[263]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Jeanne breathed. &ldquo;He will die in
flames!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marjory Dean pressed her hand hard.</p>
<p>Of a sudden the floor beneath the white figure
opened and swallowed him up.</p>
<p>Jeanne looked for the dragon. It was gone.
The fiery red of the curtain was turning to an
orange glow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come. You have seen.&rdquo; It was Hop Long
Lee who spoke. Once again his marble-cold
hand touched Jeanne&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>Ten minutes later the four figures were once
more in the street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Midnight in an Oriental garden,&rdquo; Angelo
breathed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; breathed Marjory Dean, &ldquo;is drama,
Oriental drama. Give it a human touch and
it could be made supreme.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;you think it could be made into a
thing of beauty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely. Most certainly, my child. Nothing
could be more unique.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_264">[264]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; whispered Jeanne happily. &ldquo;Come
with me. The night is young. The day is for
sleep. Come. We will have coffee by my fire.
Then we will talk, talk of all this. We will
create an opera in a night. Is it not so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And it was so.</p>
<p>A weird bit of opera it was that they produced
that night. Even the atmosphere in
which they worked was fantastic. Candle
light, a flickering fire that now and then leaped
into sudden conflagration, mellow-toned gongs
provided by the little lady of the cameo; such
were the elements that added to the fantastic
reality of the unreal.</p>
<p>In this one-act drama the giant paper
dragon remained. The flaming curtain, the
setting for some weird Buddhist ceremony,
was to furnish the motif. A flesh and blood
person, whose part was to be played by Marjory
Dean, replaced the thing of white cloth
and paper that had danced a weird dance, and
became entangled in the fiery curtain. Oriental
mystery, the deep hatred of some types of yellow
men for the white race, these entered into
the story.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_265">[265]</div>
<p>In the plot the hero (Marjory Dean), a
white boy, son of a rich trader, caught by the
lure of mystery, adventure and tales of the
magic curtain, volunteers to take the place of
a rich Chinese youth who is to endure the trial
by fire.</p>
<p>A very ugly old Chinaman, who holds the
white boy in high regard, learning of his plans
and realizing his peril, prepares the trap-door
in the floor beneath the magic curtain.</p>
<p>When the hour comes for the trial by fire,
the white boy, being ignorant of the secrets
that will save him, appears doomed as the
flames of the curtain surround him, consuming
the very mask from his face and leaving him
there, his identity revealed in stark reality.</p>
<p>Then as the rich Chinaman, who has planned
the trial, realizes the catastrophe that must befall
his people if the rich youth is burned to
death, prepares to cast himself into the flames,
the floor opens to swallow the boy up, and the
curtain fades.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_266">[266]</div>
<p>There is not space here to tell of the motives
of love, hate, pride and patriotism that lay
back of this bit of drama. Enough that when
it was done Marjory Dean pronounced it the
most perfect bit of opera yet produced in
America.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you will be our diva?&rdquo; Jeanne was all
eagerness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall be proud to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; Angelo&rsquo;s eyes shone, &ldquo;then we are
indeed rich once more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Your beautiful rugs, your desk, your
ancient friend the piano, they shall all come
back to you.&rdquo; In her joy Jeanne could have
embraced him. As it was she wrung his hand
in parting, and thanked him over and over for
his part in this bit of work and adventure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The music,&rdquo; she whispered to Swen, &ldquo;you
will do it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is as well as done. The wind whispering
in the graveyard pines at midnight. This is
done by reeds and strings. And there are the
gongs, the deep melodious gongs of China.
What more could one ask?&rdquo;</p>
<p>What more, indeed?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_267">[267]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said Florence, after she had,
some hours later, listened to Jeanne&rsquo;s recital
of that night&rsquo;s affairs, &ldquo;now that it is all over,
what is there in it all for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For me?&rdquo; Jeanne spread her hands wide.
&ldquo;Nothing. Nothing at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only this,&rdquo; Jeanne interrupted her, &ldquo;you
said once that one found the best joy in life by
helping others. Well then,&rdquo; she laughed a little
laugh, &ldquo;I have helped a little.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you shall see, my time will come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Was she right? Does one sometimes serve
himself best by serving others? We shall see.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_268">[268]</div>
<h2 id="c30"><br />CHAPTER XXX
<br />A SURPRISE PARTY</h2>
<p>Time marched on, as time has a way of
doing. A week passed, another and yet
another. Each night of opera found Jeanne,
still masquerading as Pierre, at her post among
the boxes. Never forgetting that a priceless
necklace had been stolen from those boxes and
that she had run away, ever conscious of the
searching eyes of Jaeger and of the inscrutable
shadow that was the lady in black, Jeanne
performed her tasks as one who walks beneath
a shadow that in a moment may be turned
into impenetrable darkness.</p>
<p>For all this, she still thrilled to the color,
the music, the drama, which is Grand Opera.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some day,&rdquo; she had a way of whispering
to herself, &ldquo;some happy day!&rdquo; Yet that day
seemed indistinct and far away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_269">[269]</div>
<p>The dark-faced menace to her happiness, he
of the evil eye, appeared to have vanished.
Perhaps he was in jail. Who could tell?</p>
<p>The little Frenchman with the message, too,
had vanished. Why had he never returned to
ask Pierre, the usher in the boxes, the correct
address of Petite Jeanne? Beyond doubt he
believed himself the victim of a practical joke.
&ldquo;This boy Pierre knows nothing regarding
the whereabouts of that person named Petite
Jeanne.&rdquo; Thus he must have reasoned. At any
rate the message was not delivered. If Jeanne
had lost a relative by death, if she had inherited
a fortune or was wanted for some misdemeanor
committed in France, she remained
blissfully ignorant of it all.</p>
<p>Three times Rosemary Robinson had invited
her to visit her at her home. Three times, as
Pierre, politely but firmly, she had refused.
&ldquo;This affair,&rdquo; she told herself, &ldquo;has gone far
enough. Before our friendship ripens or is
blighted altogether, I must reveal to her my
identity. And that I am not yet willing to do.
It might rob me of my place in this great
palace of art.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_270">[270]</div>
<p>Thanks to Marjory Dean, the little French
girl&rsquo;s training in Grand Opera proceeded day
by day. Without assigning a definite reason
for it, the prima donna had insisted upon giving
her hours of training each week in the role
of the juggler.</p>
<p>More than this, she had all but compelled
Jeanne to become her understudy in the forthcoming
one-act opera to be known as &ldquo;The
Magic Curtain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At an opportune moment Marjory Dean had
introduced the manager of the opera to all the
fantastic witchery of this new opera. He had
been taken by it.</p>
<p>At once he had agreed that when the &ldquo;Juggler&rdquo;
was played, this new opera should be
presented to the public.</p>
<p>So Jeanne lived in a world of dreams, dreams
that she felt could never come true. &ldquo;But I am
learning,&rdquo; she would whisper to herself,
&ldquo;learning of art and life. What more could
one ask?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_271">[271]</div>
<p>Then came a curious invitation. She was to
visit the studios of Fernando Tiffin. The invitation
came through Marjory Dean. Strangest
of all, she was to appear as Pierre.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why Pierre?&rdquo; she pondered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, why?&rdquo; Florence echoed. &ldquo;But, after
all, such an invitation! Fernando Tiffin is the
greatest sculptor in America. Have you seen
the fountain by the Art Museum?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where the pigeons are always bathing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is beautiful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He created that statue, and many others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That reminds me,&rdquo; Jeanne sought out her
dress suit and began searching its pockets, &ldquo;an
artist, an interesting man with a beard, gave
me his card. He told me to visit his studio. He
was going to tell me more about lights and
shadows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lights and shadows?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. How they are like life. But now I
have lost his card.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_272">[272]</div>
<p>Florence returned to the island. There she
sat long in the sunshine by the rocky shore,
talking with Aunt Bobby. She found the good
lady greatly perplexed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve served notice,&rdquo; Aunt Bobby sighed,
&ldquo;the park folks have. All that is to come
down.&rdquo; She waved an arm toward the cottonwood
thicket and the &ldquo;Cathedral.&rdquo; &ldquo;A big
building is going up. Steam shovels are working
over on the west side now. Any day, now,
we&rsquo;ll have to pack up, Meg and me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And where&rsquo;ll we go? Back to the ships, I
suppose. I hate it for Meg. She ought to have
more schoolin&rsquo;. But poor folks can&rsquo;t pick and
choose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There will be a way out,&rdquo; Florence consoled
her. But would there? Who could tell?</p>
<p>She hunted up Meg and advised her to look
into that mysterious package. &ldquo;It may be a
bomb.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it is, it won&rsquo;t go off by itself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be a gun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t need a gun. Got two of &rsquo;em. Good
ones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be stolen treasure.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_273">[273]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I didn&rsquo;t steal it!&rdquo; Meg turned flashing
eyes upon her. And there for a time the
matter ended.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>Jeanne attended the great sculptor&rsquo;s party.
Since she had not been invited to accompany
Marjory Dean, she went alone. What did it
matter? Miss Dean was to be there. That was
enough.</p>
<p>She arrived at three o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon.
A servant answered the bell. She was ushered
at once into a vast place with a very high ceiling.
All about her were statues and plaster-of-paris
reproductions of masterpieces.</p>
<p>Scarcely had she time to glance about her
when she heard a voice, saw a face and knew
she had found an old friend&mdash;the artist who
had spoken so interestingly of life, he of the
beard, was before her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So this is where you work?&rdquo; She was overjoyed.
&ldquo;And does the great Fernando Tiffin
do his work here, too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am Fernando Tiffin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Jeanne swayed a little.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_274">[274]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; the other smiled, putting out a
hand to steady her, &ldquo;I, too, like to study life
among those who do not know me; to masquerade
a little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Masquerade!&rdquo; Jeanne started. Did he,
then, see through her own pretenses? She
flushed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But no!&rdquo; She fortified herself. &ldquo;How could
he know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You promised to tell me more about life.&rdquo;
She hurried to change the subject.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes. How fine! There is yet time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see.&rdquo; He threw a switch. The place
was flooded with light. &ldquo;The thing that stands
before you, the &lsquo;Fairy and the Child,&rsquo; it is
called. It is a reproduction of a great masterpiece:
a perfect reproduction, yet in this light
it is nothing; a blare of white, that is all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But see!&rdquo; He touched one button, then another,
and, behold, the statue stood before
them a thing of exquisite beauty!</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see?&rdquo; he smiled. &ldquo;Now there are shadows,
perfect shadows, just enough, and just
enough light.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_275">[275]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Life is like that. There must be shadows.
Without shadows we could not be conscious
of light. But when the lights are too bright,
the shadows too deep, then all is wrong.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your bright lights of life at the Opera
House, the sable coats, the silks and jewels,
they are a form of life. But there the lights
are too strong. They blind the eyes, hide the
true beauty that may be beneath it all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But out there on that vacant lot, in the cold
and dark&mdash;you have not forgotten?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall never forget.&rdquo; Jeanne&rsquo;s voice was
low.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There the shadows were too deep. It was
like this.&rdquo; He touched still another button.
The beauty of the statue was once more lost,
this time in a maze of shadows too deep and
strong.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see.&rdquo; His voice was gentle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But here are more guests arriving. You
may not be aware of it, but this is to be an
afternoon of opera, not of art.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_276">[276]</div>
<p>Soon enough Jeanne was to know this, for,
little as she had dreamed it, hers on that occasion
was to be the stellar role.</p>
<p>It was Marjory Dean who had entered.
With her was the entire cast of &ldquo;The Magic
Curtain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has asked that we conduct a dress rehearsal
here for the benefit of a few choice
friends,&rdquo; Miss Dean whispered in Jeanne&rsquo;s ear,
as soon as she could draw her aside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A strange request, I&rsquo;ll grant you,&rdquo; she answered
Jeanne&rsquo;s puzzled look. &ldquo;Not half so
strange as this, however. He wishes you to
take the stellar role.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Miss Dean!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is his party. His word is law in many
places. You will do your best for me.&rdquo; She
pressed Jeanne&rsquo;s hand hard.</p>
<p>Jeanne did her best. And undoubtedly, despite
the lack of a truly magic curtain, despite
the limitations of the improvised stage, the
audience was visibly impressed.</p>
<p>At the end, as Jeanne sank from sight beneath
the stage, the great sculptor leaned over
to whisper in Marjory Dean&rsquo;s ear:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_277">[277]</div>
<p>&ldquo;She will do it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did I tell you? To be sure she will!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The operatic portion of the program at an
end, the guests were treated to a brief lecture
on the art of sculpture. Tea was served. The
guests departed. Through it all Jeanne walked
about in a daze. &ldquo;It is as if I had been invited
to my own wedding and did not so much as
know I was married,&rdquo; she said to Florence,
later in the day.</p>
<p>Florence smiled and made no reply. There
was more to come, much more. Florence believed
that. But Jeanne had not so much as
guessed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_278">[278]</div>
<h2 id="c31"><br />CHAPTER XXXI
<br />FLORENCE MEETS THE LADY IN BLACK</h2>
<p>The great hour came at last. &ldquo;To-night,&rdquo;
Jeanne had whispered, &ldquo;&lsquo;The Magic Curtain&rsquo;
will unfold before thousands! Will it be
a success?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The very thought that it might prove a
failure turned her cold. The happiness of her
good friends, Angelo, Swen and Marjory Dean
was at stake. And to Jeanne the happiness of
those she respected and loved was more dear
than her own.</p>
<p>Night came quite suddenly on that eventful
day. Great dark clouds, sweeping in from the
lake, drew the curtain of night.</p>
<p>Jeanne found herself at her place among the
boxes a full hour before the time required.
This was not of her own planning. There was
a mystery about this; a voice had called her
on the telephone requesting her to arrive early.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_279">[279]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now I am here,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;and the
place is half dark. Who can have requested
it? What could have been the reason?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still another mystery. Florence was with
her. And she was to remain. A place had been
provided for her in the box usually occupied
by Rosemary Robinson and her family.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; she had said to Florence, &ldquo;they
know that we had something to do with the
discovery of the magic curtain. It is, perhaps,
because of this that you are here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence had smiled, but had made no reply.</p>
<p>At this hour the great auditorium was silent,
deserted. Only from behind the drawn
stage curtain came a faint murmur, telling of
last minute preparations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The Magic Curtain.&rsquo;&rdquo; Jeanne whispered.
The words still thrilled her. &ldquo;It will be witnessed
to-night by thousands. What will be
the verdict? To-morrow Angelo and Swen,
my friends of our &lsquo;Golden Circle,&rsquo; will be
rich or very, very poor.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_280">[280]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The Magic Curtain.&rdquo; Surely it had been
given a generous amount of publicity. Catching
a note of the unusual, the mysterious, the
uncanny in this production, the reporters had
made the most of it. An entire page of the
Sunday supplement had been devoted to it.
A crude drawing of the curtains, pictures of
Hop Long Lee, of Angelo, Swen, Marjory
Dean, and even Jeanne were there. And with
these a most lurid story purporting to be the
history of this curtain of fire as it had existed
through the ages in some little known Buddhist
temple. The very names of those who,
wrapped in its consuming folds, had perished,
were given in detail. Jeanne had read, had
shuddered, then had tried to laugh it off as
a reporter&rsquo;s tale. In this she did not quite succeed.
For her the magic curtain contained
more than a suggestion of terror.</p>
<p>She was thinking of all this when an attendant,
hurrying up the orchestra aisle,
paused beneath her and called her name, the
only name by which she was known at the
Opera House:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pierre! Oh, Pierre!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_281">[281]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Here. Here I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without knowing why, she thrilled to her
very finger tips. &ldquo;Is it for this that I am here?&rdquo;
she asked herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurry down!&rdquo; came from below. &ldquo;The director
wishes to speak to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The director!&rdquo; The blood froze in her veins.
So this was the end! Her masquerade had
been discovered. She was to be thrown out
of the Opera House.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And on this night of all nights!&rdquo; She was
ready to weep.</p>
<p>It was a very meek Pierre who at last stood
before the great director.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you Pierre?&rdquo; His tone was not harsh.
She began to hope a little.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am Pierre.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This man&mdash;&rdquo; The director turned to one
in the shadows. Jeanne caught her breath. It
was the great sculptor, Fernando Tiffin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This man,&rdquo; the director repeated, after she
had recovered from her surprise, &ldquo;tells me that
you know the score of this new opera, &lsquo;The
Magic Curtain.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_282">[282]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Y-yes. Yes, I do.&rdquo; What was this? Her
heart throbbed painfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that of the &lsquo;Juggler of Notre Dame.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I do.&rdquo; This time more boldly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely this can be no crime,&rdquo; she told herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This has happened,&rdquo; the director spoke out
abruptly, &ldquo;Miss Dean is at the Robinson home.
She has fallen from a horse. She will not be
able to appear to-night. Fernando Tiffin tells
me that you are prepared to assume the leading
role in these two short operas. I say it is
quite impossible. You are to be the judge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Staggered by this load that had been so suddenly
cast upon her slender shoulders, the little
French girl seemed about to sink to the floor.
Fortunately at that instant her eyes caught
the calm, reassuring gaze of the great sculptor.
&ldquo;I have said you are able.&rdquo; She read this
meaning there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Her shoulders were square now. &ldquo;I
am able.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said the director, &ldquo;you shall try.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_283">[283]</div>
<p>Ninety minutes later by the clock, she found
herself waiting her cue, the cue that was to
bid her come dancing forth upon a great stage,
the greatest in the world. And looking down
upon her, quick to applaud or to blame, were
the city&rsquo;s thousands.</p>
<p>In the meantime, in her seat among the
boxes, Florence had met with an unusual experience.
A mysterious figure had suddenly
revealed herself as one of Petite Jeanne&rsquo;s old
friends. At the same time she had half unfolded
some month-old mysteries.</p>
<p>Petite Jeanne had hardly disappeared
through the door leading to the stage when
two whispered words came from behind
Florence&rsquo;s back:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remember me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a start, the girl turned about to find
herself looking into the face of a tall woman
garbed in black.</p>
<p>Reading uncertainty in her eyes, the woman
whispered: &ldquo;Cedar Point. Gamblers&rsquo; Island.
Three rubies.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_284">[284]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The &lsquo;lady cop&rsquo;!&rdquo; Florence sprang to her
feet. She was looking at an old friend. Many
of her most thrilling adventures had been encountered
in the presence of this lady of the
police.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it was you!&rdquo; she exclaimed in a low
whisper. &ldquo;You are Jeanne&rsquo;s lady in black?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am the lady in black.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And she never recognized you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I arranged it so she would not. She never
saw my face. I have been a guardian of her
trail on many an occasion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now!&rdquo; Her figure grew tense, like that
of a springing tiger. &ldquo;Now I am about to come
to the end of a great mystery. You can help
me. That is why I arranged that you should
be here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I?&rdquo; Florence showed her astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl obeyed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some weeks ago a priceless necklace was
stolen from this very box. You recall that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How could I forget?&rdquo; Florence sat up, all
attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course. Petite Jeanne, she is your best
friend.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_285">[285]</div>
<p>&ldquo;She cast suspicion upon herself by deserting
her post here; running away. Had it
not been for me, she would have gone to jail.
I had seen through her masquerade at once.
&lsquo;This,&rsquo; I said to myself, &lsquo;is Petite Jeanne. She
would not steal a dime.&rsquo; I convinced others.
They spared her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; she paused for a space of seconds,
&ldquo;it was up to me to find the pearls and the
thief. I think I have accomplished this; at
least I have found the pearls. As I said, you
can help me. You know the people living on
that curious man-made island?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;&rdquo; Florence was thunderstruck.</p>
<p>Aunt Bobby! Meg! How could they be implicated?
All this she said to herself and was
fearful.</p>
<p>Then, like a bolt from the blue came a picture
of Meg&rsquo;s birthday package.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know those people?&rdquo; the &ldquo;lady cop&rdquo;
insisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;why, yes, I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will go there with me after the opera?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At night?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_286">[286]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There is need for haste. We will go in Robinson&rsquo;s
big car. Jaeger will go, and Rosemary.
Perhaps Jeanne, too. You will be ready? That
is all for now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only this: I think Jeanne is to have the
stellar role to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jeanne! The stellar role? How could that
be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it has been arranged.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Arranged?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There came no answer. The lady in black
was gone.</p>

<h2 id="c32"><br />CHAPTER XXXII
<br />SPARKLING TREASURE</h2>
<p>The strangest moment in the little French
girl&rsquo;s career was that in which, as the juggler,
she tripped out upon the Opera House
stage. More than three thousand people had
assembled in this great auditorium to see and
hear their favorite, the city&rsquo;s darling, Marjory
Dean, perform in her most famous role. She
was not here. They would know this at once.
What would the answer be?</p>
<p>The answer, after perfunctory applause, was
a deep hush of silence. It was as if the audience
had said: &ldquo;Marjory Dean is not here.
Ah, well, let us see what this child can do.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_288">[288]</div>
<p>Only her tireless work under Miss Dean&rsquo;s
direction saved Jeanne from utter collapse.
Used as she was to the smiling faces and boisterous
applause of the good old light opera
days, this silence seemed appalling. As it was,
she played her part with a perfection that was
art, devoid of buoyancy. This, at first. But
as the act progressed she took a tight grip on
herself and throwing herself into the part,
seemed to shout at the dead audience: &ldquo;You
shall look! You shall hear! You must applaud!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For all this, when the curtain was run down
upon the scene, the applause, as before, lacked
enthusiasm. She answered but one curtain
call, then crept away alone to clench her small
hands hard in an endeavor to keep back the
tears and to pray as she had never prayed before,
that Marjory Dean might arrive prepared
to play her part before the curtain went up on
the second act.</p>
<p>But now a strange thing was happening.
From one corner of the house there came a
low whisper and a murmur. It grew and grew;
it spread and spread until, like a fire sweeping
the dead grass of the prairies, it had passed
to the darkest nook of the vast auditorium.</p>
<p>Curiously enough, a name was on every lip;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Petite Jeanne!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_289">[289]</div>
<p>Someone, a fan of other days, had penetrated
the girl&rsquo;s mask and had seen there the
light opera favorite of a year before. A thousand
people in that audience had known and
loved her in those good dead days that were
gone.</p>
<p>When Jeanne, having waited and hoped in
vain for the appearance of her friend and benefactor,
summoned all the courage she
possessed, and once more stepped upon the
stage, she was greeted by such a round of applause
as she had never before experienced&mdash;not
even in the good old days of yesteryear.</p>
<p>This vast audience had suddenly taken her
to its heart. How had this come about? Ah,
well, what did it matter? They were hers, hers
for one short hour. She must make the most
of this golden opportunity.</p>
<p>That which followed, the completing of the
&ldquo;Juggler,&rdquo; the opening of &ldquo;The Magic Curtain,&rdquo;
the complete triumph of this new American
opera, will always remain to Jeanne a
beautiful dream. She walked and danced, she
sang and bowed as one in a dream.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_290">[290]</div>
<p>The great moment of all came when, after
answering the fifth curtain call with her name,
&ldquo;Petite Jeanne! Petite Jeanne!&rdquo; echoing to the
vaulted ceiling, she left the stage to walk
square into the arms of Marjory Dean.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I thought&mdash;&rdquo; She paused, too astounded
for words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You thought I had fallen from a horse.
So I did&mdash;a leather horse with iron legs. It
was in a gymnasium. Rosemary pushed me
off. Truly it did not hurt at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A frame-up!&rdquo; Jeanne stared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, a frame-up for a good cause. &lsquo;The
Magic Curtain&rsquo; was yours, not mine. You discovered
it. It was through your effort that
this little opera was perfected. It was yours,
not mine. Your golden hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My golden hour!&rdquo; the little French girl repeated
dreamily. &ldquo;But not ever again. Not
until I have sung and sung, and studied and
studied shall I appear again on such a stage!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Child, you have the wisdom of the gods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the director!&rdquo; Jeanne&rsquo;s mood changed.
&ldquo;Does he not hate you?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_291">[291]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Quite the contrary. He loves me. Why
should he not? I have found him a fresh little
American opera and a future star. His vast
audience has gone away happy. What more
could he ask?&rdquo;</p>
<p>What more, indeed?</p>
<p>But what is this? Florence is at Jeanne&rsquo;s
side. What is she saying? &ldquo;They think they
have discovered the whereabouts of Rosemary&rsquo;s
pearls. On the island.&rdquo; Would she go
with them? Most certainly, and at once. But
alas, she has no clothes save those of Pierre,
the usher of the boxes. Ah, well, they must
do. She will be ready at once. Yes! Yes! At
once! Right away!</p>
<p>They were all tumbling helter-skelter into
the big town car, Jeanne, Florence, Rosemary,
Jaeger, the &ldquo;lady cop&rdquo; and even Marjory Dean,
when a dapper little man approached the car
to ask for Petite Jeanne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is here,&rdquo; the &ldquo;lady cop&rdquo; informed him.
Indeed she was, and wedged in so tight it was
difficult to move.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_292">[292]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! At last!&rdquo; the little man sighed. &ldquo;May
I speak with her? It has been my privilege to
bear a message from France.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A message!&rdquo; Jeanne thrilled to the tips of
her toes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid it is impossible.&rdquo; The &ldquo;lady
cop&rsquo;s&rdquo; tone was business-like. &ldquo;It is late. Our
errand is of the greatest importance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, too, is my message. If you will permit,
I shall accompany you.&rdquo; Looking in the
crowded car, he opened the driver&rsquo;s door and,
hearing no objections, took his place beside
the chauffeur.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And mystery still pursued her,&rdquo; Florence
whispered to herself, as she studied the back
of the little Frenchman&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>Jeanne was crowded in between Rosemary
and the &ldquo;lady cop.&rdquo; As Rosemary&rsquo;s arm stole
about her, still conscious of her dress suit and
her masquerade, she moved uneasily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, little French girl,&rdquo; Rosemary
whispered. &ldquo;I have known all the time that
you were Petite Jeanne and not Pierre.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the same,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;I have enjoyed
this little play at life quite as much as you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_293">[293]</div>
<p>With a little sigh of relief Jeanne sank back
among the cushions.</p>
<p>Down the boulevard they sped; across a
rattling wooden bridge, then across the wind-blown,
sandy island.</p>
<p>The car came to a stop at the entrance to
the path that led to Aunt Bobby&rsquo;s &ldquo;Cathedral.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would do well to let me go first,&rdquo;
Florence said to Jaeger and the &ldquo;lady cop.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Meg, the girl, has two fine revolvers. She
can use them and will do so if she believes she
is being attacked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fortunately there was no trouble about securing
an entrance. The strange pair had not
yet retired. At the sound of Florence&rsquo;s voice
they threw wide the door. At sight of her numerous
company, however, they appeared
ready to slam it shut again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a little lark.&rdquo; Florence reassured them.
&ldquo;We have come all the way from the opera to
a &lsquo;Cathedral.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, come in then.&rdquo; Aunt Bobby moved
aside to let them pass.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_294">[294]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; said Florence, when they had
crowded into the small living room, &ldquo;this lady
here,&rdquo; she nodded at the &ldquo;lady cop,&rdquo; &ldquo;has a
curious notion about that birthday package
of yours, Meg. She believes it contains a pearl
necklace of great value.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&mdash;&rdquo; Meg&rsquo;s face flushed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A reward of a thousand dollars has been
offered for its return,&rdquo; the &ldquo;lady cop&rdquo; put in
quickly. &ldquo;If you have recovered it, that reward
will be your own. Think what that will mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I have waited all this time!&rdquo; Meg protested.
&ldquo;And to-morrow is my birthday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence glanced hastily at her watch. She
smiled. &ldquo;Not to-morrow, but to-day.&rdquo; She
showed that it was fifteen minutes past twelve.</p>
<p>With her last objection overruled, Meg produced
the mysterious package. At once a little
circle of eager ones gathered about her.</p>
<p>With trembling hands, she untied the cord.
She had all but unrolled the black wrapping
when the package, slipping from her nerveless
fingers, fell to the floor.</p>
<p>At once there came flashing back to them all
manner of color: white, pink, red and green.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_295">[295]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not pearls alone, but diamonds, rubies,
sapphires!&rdquo; the &ldquo;lady cop&rdquo; said, in an awed
tone. &ldquo;What a treasure!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the same time, with a little cry of joy,
Rosemary bent over to seize her string of
pearls and clasp them about her neck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A thousand dollars, Meg!&rdquo; It was Aunt
Bobby who spoke. &ldquo;They said a thousand.
That will settle all our troubles for many a
day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there will be more, much more.&rdquo; The
&ldquo;lady cop&rdquo; began carefully gathering up the
scattered jewels. &ldquo;All these were stolen. There
will be other rewards, and that which is never
claimed may be sold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That dark-faced one thought he had chosen
a safe place to hide it!&rdquo; Meg laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was close pressed by the police,&rdquo; the
&ldquo;lady cop&rdquo; explained. &ldquo;It was his one chance.
And he lost; which was right enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; came in a polite tone from the
corner, &ldquo;if I may have a word with Petite
Jeanne?&rdquo; It was the little Frenchman. &ldquo;But
where is she? I do not see her.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_296">[296]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Meg,&rdquo; said Jeanne imploringly, &ldquo;have you
a dress to loan me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure have!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They disappeared.</p>
<p>Five minutes later Jeanne reappeared in a
blue calico dress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am Petite Jeanne.&rdquo; She bowed low to the
little Frenchman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes! So you are. Then it is my pleasure
to announce that you are sole heir to a great
castle in France. It is known as &lsquo;<i>Le Neuf
Chateau</i>.&rsquo; But it is truly very old and carries
with it a broad estate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A castle!&rdquo; Jeanne seemed undecided
whether to shout or weep. &ldquo;A great castle for
poor little me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, my child,&rdquo; the Frenchman put in quickly,
&ldquo;it will not be necessary&mdash;it is quite unnecessary
for you to reside there. Indeed, at
this moment it is rented, for an unheard of
rental, to a rich American who fancies castles
and is fond of following the hounds.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_297">[297]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; exclaimed Jeanne, &ldquo;I shall accept!
I shall return to my beautiful Paris. And
there, forever and ever, I shall study for the
opera. Is it not so, Marjory Dean?</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you, all of you, shall come to Paris as
my guests.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, on some bright summer&rsquo;s day,&rdquo;
the great prima donna agreed.</p>
<p>That night&mdash;or shall we say morning?&mdash;Petite
Jeanne arranged &ldquo;Pierre&rsquo;s&rdquo; carefully
pressed dress suit upon a hanger and hung it
deep in the shadows of her closet. &ldquo;Good-bye
Pierre,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;You brought me fear
and sorrow, hope, romance, a better understanding
of life, and, after that, a brief moment
of triumph. I wonder if it is to be farewell
forever or only adieu for to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And now, my reader, it is time to draw the
magic curtain. And what of that curtain? Up
to this moment you know quite as much as I
do. It was used in but one performance of the
opera that bears its name. It was then withdrawn
by its owner. Not, however, until a
stage-property curtain, produced with the aid
of tiny copper wires, strips of asbestos and
colored ribbons, had been created to take its
place. The secret of the original magic curtain
is still locked in the breast of its oriental
creator.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_298">[298]</div>
<p>The dark-faced one has not, so far as I
know, been apprehended. Perhaps he fled to
another city and has there met his just fate.
Why he haunted the trail of the page of the
opera, Pierre, is known to him alone, and the
doer of dark deeds seldom talks.</p>
<p>And so the story ends. But what of the days
that were to follow? Did that little company
indeed journey all the way to Paris? And did
they find mystery and great adventure in
Jeanne&rsquo;s vast castle? Did Jeanne tire of studying
opera &ldquo;forever and ever&rdquo; and did she return
to America? Or did our old friend,
Florence, forgetting her blonde companion of
many mysteries, go forth with others to seek
adventure? If you wish these questions answered
you must read our next volume, which
is to be known as: <b><i>Hour of Enchantment</i></b>.</p>
